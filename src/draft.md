# Introduction

<section>

Derived from the progress of multimedia interactive entertainment software (MIES), the concept of internationalization is introduced to the field of translation. Internationalization, a superset of translation, encompasses various elements, including translation itself and aspects such as multimedia and interactivity. This broader perspective significantly influences the development of translation studies. This paper aims to apply certain MIES internationalization theories and practices to a domain beyond MIES, specifically addressing translation or internationalization issues within science museums in Beijing. From this novel viewpoint, this identifies errors in the English internationalization in science museums in Beijing, ranging from traditional concerns like incorrect spelling, punctuation, and grammar to MIES-specific problems such as inappropriate typography and the absence of multimedia translation.

## Research Background

This study is contextualized by two pivotal factors: the rapidly expanding MIES industry (as well as its internationalization industry) and the increasing significance of science museums in Beijing. Subsequently, this chapter will delineate each of these factors individually.

### MIES Internationalization

Historically, Translation Studies have primarily focused on textual analysis, neglecting the dynamic nature of intercultural communication. With the rise of digital technology, translation has evolved to encompass multimedia and interactive entertainment products, particularly MIES. As has been previously discussed by Bernal-Merino^[MERINO M B. On the Translation of Video Games[J]. The Journal of Specialised Translation, 2006. ], MIES combines in one product characteristics of other arts and disciplines such as film, literature, 3-D design, and computer programming and provides multimedia and unparalleled interactivity, challenging traditional translation paradigms.

Translation, traditionally concerned with words, now extends beyond mere linguistic representation. The global phenomenon of MIES, exemplified by titles like _Dying Light 2 Stay Human_, underscores how interactivity can shape the narrative, adapting to public reactions. The internationalization process, covering globalization, internationalization, localization, and translation (GILT), is pivotal for the success of MIES in international markets.

Interactivity, not confined to digital media, has existed in various forms of entertainment like drama and literature. For instance, Julio Cortázar's novel _Rayuela_ challenges conventional narrative structures, and game books like the _Fighting Fantasy_ series offer readers choices impacting the story. MIES elevate interactivity, enabling users to directly control their avatars and the narrative.

Language plays a crucial role in MIES interactivity, involving users in dialogues and providing feedback through multimedia like text, audio, or video. Translation must capture the nuances of these exchanges, ensuring the immersive experience of MIES transcends language barriers. Achieving this requires linguistic flexibility, adherence to syntactical and morphological rules, and cultural sensitivity to maintain user immersion.

Internationalization surpasses mere translation; it tailors a MIES to the cultural, legal, and technical needs of its target audience. Playability, ease, and enjoyment of using an MIES, directly hinges on the quality of internationalization. Errors in gender, number agreement, or mode of address can compromise user experience. Meticulous internationalization is essential to ensure the coherence and engagement of the MIES's narrative and mechanics in all languages.

MIES marks a new frontier in translation studies, where interactivity and internationalization assume paramount importance. Preserving the interactive essence of MIES while adapting them to diverse linguistic and cultural contexts poses a challenge. As MIES continues to evolve, the field of translation must also evolve, embracing the complexities of intercultural communication and the creative possibilities of interactive storytelling.

### Science Museums in Beijing

In an era characterized by globalization and the pervasive influence of information technology, science museums have emerged as pivotal contributors to the dissemination of scientific knowledge and cultural exchange. Beijing, serving as the capital of China, stands at the forefront of this transformative movement, hosting an array of science museums that cater to both local and international audiences. The significance of English internationalization within these institutions cannot be overstated, as it not only facilitates cross-cultural communication but also amplifies the global impact of Beijing's science education endeavors.

The imperative of English internationalization is accentuated by the surge in inbound tourism in China. Since the initiation of reforms and opening up, China's inbound tourism industry has witnessed unprecedented growth. According to data from the National Bureau of Statistics, between 1978 and 2019, the number of inbound tourists in China increased nearly 140-fold. Consequently, China has ascended to become the world's fourth-largest inbound tourism destination, trailing only France, Spain, and the United States^[World Tourism Organization. (2023). Global and regional tourism performance [Database]. Madrid, Spain: World Tourism Organization.]. As the focal point of China, Beijing annually attracts over 60 million international tourists, solidifying its status as the country's premier destination.

The rapid evolution of China's science communication sector has led to the establishment of diverse science museums nationwide, each adhering to modern principles of scientific center construction. These museums employ thematic and comprehensive classification methods, fostering audience participation and interactive experiences. As these museums expand, their involvement in international affairs increases, with engagements spanning organizations such as the Science Centre World Congress (SCWC), the Association of Science and Technology Centers (ASTC), the Asia Pacific Network of Science and Technology Centres (ASPAC), the European Network of Science Centres and Museums (Ecsite), among others^[杨玉娟.浅谈完形理论在科技馆翻译中的运用[J].牡丹江教育学院学报,2014(05):40-41.]. Precise conveyance of professional information and terminology in English is pivotal for these interactions, underscoring the necessity for advanced research in English internationalization.

The "Belt and Road" initiative (BRI), spearheaded by China, further underscores the importance of English internationalization. In 2017, the China Science and Technology Museum (CSTM) hosted the inaugural International Symposium on The Development of Natural Science Museums under BRI (BRISMIS). This initiative has culminated in successful exhibitions abroad, such as the "Ancient Chinese Science and Technology Exhibition" in Greece and the "China Mobile Science Museum" project in Myanmar, both receiving positive feedback from local governments and the public. In 2018, CSTM showcased six aerospace-themed exhibits at the Dome Science Center in Malaysia, marking the first instance of the CSTM's permanent exhibits venturing beyond national borders. This initiative represents a significant attempt to promote China's high-tech industries through science popularization and cooperative exchanges along the BRI countries. Moreover, CSTM provides technical and intellectual support to BRI nations. For instance, in August 2018, CSTM dispatched an expert team to Sri Lanka, earning high praise for providing technical support in infrastructure and exhibition planning for Sri Lanka's National Science Centre project^[张. 北京旅游网专访中国科技馆副馆长廖红：努力建设中国特色现代科技馆体系引领中国科普事业发展, 北京旅游网, 2018-12-07. (2018-12-07)[2024-01-05]. https://www.visitbeijing.com.cn/article/47Qkrqdf8cV.].

In conclusion, the imperative of English internationalization in Beijing's science museums is pivotal for augmenting international communication, fostering cultural exchange, and showcasing China's scientific accomplishments on a global platform. As China continues to actively participate in global scientific discourse, the significance of precise and culturally sensitive translation will only escalate, ensuring that Beijing's science museums remain accessible and captivating to visitors from across the globe.

## Research Objectives

As previously highlighted, MIES internationalization offers a novel perspective for evaluating what is conventionally termed "translation." This approach introduces two additional dimensions for evaluation: multimedia and interactivity. Recognizing certain shared characteristics between the MIES internationalization industry and science museums, both involving multimedia and interactivity, this study aims to leverage these dimensions, alongside the textual element, to assess Chinese-English translation within science museums in Beijing. To streamline the expression and distinguish it from traditional translation quality assessments, this new perspective is termed "internationalization quality assessment" in this paper.

The research objectives are twofold. Firstly, the study endeavors to identify latent errors within the internationalization of science museums in Beijing. To ensure objectivity, all assessments will adhere to widely acknowledged standards, which will be comprehensively introduced in the methodology chapter. Secondly, the research aims to delve into the root causes of these identified mistakes and subsequently provide insightful solutions to prevent their recurrence. This dual-pronged approach contributes practical strategies for elevating the quality of Chinese-English translations in the context of science museums in Beijing.

## Research Significance

This research holds significance in its potential to elevate internationalization practices within science museums in Beijing, thereby enhancing the visitor experience for a global audience. By applying MIES internationalization theories to the context of science museums, this study aims to bridge the gap between evolving translation studies and the practical needs of cultural institutions in the digital age.

### Advancing Translation Studies

This research contributes to the academic discourse by broadening the scope of translation studies to encompass multimedia and interactivity as crucial components. It challenges conventional translation paradigms by illustrating the significance of cultural and contextual adaptability within MIES, a concept extendable to other interactive and multimedia content within museums.

### Cultural Exchange and Diplomacy

As Beijing's science museums increasingly participate in international collaborations and cultural diplomacy, the quality of English internationalization emerges as a pivotal factor in effective communication. The findings of this study will be pivotal in refining the museums' internationalization strategies, thereby facilitating a deeper appreciation of Chinese scientific accomplishments and cultural heritage among international visitors.

### Methodological Innovation

Lastly, this research signifies methodological innovation by devising an internationalization quality assessment framework for traditional translation, drawing inspiration from best practices in the well-established MISE industry. This initiative aims to modernize and enhance the efficiency and accuracy of the traditional translation industry.

In summary, this research not only addresses the immediate need to enhance internationalization practices within Beijing's science museums but also contributes to broader academic discussions within translation studies. By advocating for a more inclusive approach that embraces multimedia and interactivity, it sets a precedent for future research in this field. Furthermore, its implications extend beyond the academic realm, offering practical insights for cultural institutions navigating the complexities of international collaboration and communication. Ultimately, this study strives to foster mutual understanding and appreciation across cultures, thereby enriching the global discourse on science and cultural heritage.

# Literature and Practice Review

<section>

As highlighted earlier, this study delves into three dimensions of internationalization: text, multimedia, and interactivity. This chapter will provide a concise introduction to each of these aspects.

## Translation of Text

Among the three dimensions under consideration, text translation stands out as the most extensively studied field due to the historical prominence of text as a medium for information exchange. Within the context of internationalization in science museums, a seminal theory is a linguistic landscape introduced by Landry and Bourhis^[LANDRY R, BOURHIS R Y. Linguistic Landscape and ethnolinguistic vitality[J]. Journal of Language and Social Psychology, 1997, 16(1): 23–49.]. This theory defines linguistic landscape as the language present on public signs, encompassing road signs, billboards, street names, place names, shop signs, and public building signs within a defined territory, region, or city group. Widely cited, this definition is considered a classic in the field, with other scholars emphasizing the public space as the foundational backdrop of the linguistic landscape. For example, Ben-Rafael^[BEN-RAFAEL E. A sociological approach to the study of Linguistic Landscapes[J]. Linguistic Landscape, 2008: 48–62.] employs the concept of the "public sphere" proposed by German sociologist Habermas to describe the public spaces where signs are present.

In the domain of analyzing errors in Chinese-English translation using linguistic landscape theory, scholars have frequently highlighted the issue of **consistency**. For instance, Tian Feiyang and Zhang Weijia^[田飞洋, 张维佳. 全球化社会语言学:语言景观研究的新理论——以北京市学院路双语公示语为例[J]. 语言文字应用, 2014(02):38-45. DOI:10.16499/j.cnki.1003-5397.2014.02.005.] identified discrepancies such as "QINGHUA East Rd" and "QINGHUA DONGLU" being two English names for the same road, potentially confusing for foreigners. Given the widespread use of Pinyin in China, this issue is prevalent. Another example comes from Qiu Ying^[邱莹. 上饶市语言景观调查研究[J]. 语言文字应用, 2016(03):40-49. DOI:10.16499/j.cnki.1003-5397.2016.03.005.], who found common mix-ups like "LU" and "RD," "DADAO" and "AVENUE," and "SHAN" and "MT" in Shangrao city. This paper will similarly analyze consistency in the internationalization of science museums in Beijing, given its objectivity and significance.

Another frequently cited concern is proficiency in **writing English**. Sun Li's research^[孙利. 语言景观翻译的现状及其交际翻译策略[J]. 江西师范大学学报(哲学社会科学版), 2009, 42(06):153-156.] identified errors ranging from incorrect spelling, such as "China Psot" instead of "China Post," to incorrect meaning, like interpreting "watering place" as "drinking water," and grammar mistakes, for instance, "PLEASE WELL KEPT YOUR PASSWORD" instead of "Please keep your PIN number safe." A common shortcoming in papers addressing English writing errors is the absence of a standard. While it is widely known that "Psot" is misspelled in English-speaking regions, this may not suffice for more complex situations. This paper will scrutinize English writing in the internationalization of science museums in Beijing, providing standards and rationale for their selection. Further details can be found in the methodology chapter.

Some scholars have also raised concerns about **style and tone**. In the research conducted by Ding Rongrong^[丁容容. 全球化与旅游景点公共标识语翻译研究[J]. 黎明职业大学学报, 2010(04):82-86. DOI:10.13446/j.cnki.jlvu.000907.], concerns were raised about the use of terms such as "old," "disabled," and "pregnant" in public spaces, deeming them sensitive and inappropriate. However, it is important to note that this perspective may lack objectivity. For instance, Ding Rongrong proposes replacing the directive "SUNDRIES PROHIBIT" with a milder expression like "PLEASE DON'T LITTER," advocating for a more considerate tone. Nevertheless, this argument falls short as it fails to offer a systematic method for determining which words, under specific circumstances, might be considered too harsh or inappropriate. In this study, open-source language models are employed to assess the sentiment and formality of text within science museums in Beijing. This evaluation aims to determine the appropriateness of language use while maintaining objectivity, as detailed in the methodology chapter.

## Translation of Multimedia

In this section, the focus shifts to the translation of multimedia, considering **typography** as an integral component. Typography, being more of a practical concern than a theoretical one, has received limited attention in academic literature. Notably, the field of web typography, guided by Google, the developer of the widely used Chrome browser, has provided normative guidelines for web typography. This paper will utilize Google's normative guides to analyze the typography employed in science museums in Beijing, excluding subjective informative guides. Further details will be presented in the methodology chapter.

In traditional translation studies, multimedia translation was commonly referred to as **multimodal** translation. Addressing this, Kress^[KRESS G R, LEEUWEN T V. Reading images: The grammar of visual design[M]. 3rd ed. London: Routledge, Taylor & Francis Group, 2021.] argued that multimodality encompasses all channels and media involved in the communicative process, including resource sign systems such as colors, images, and music, in addition to basic linguistic symbols. Ketola^[KETOLA A. Towards a multimodally oriented theory of translation: A cognitive framework for the translation of illustrated technical texts[J]. Translation Studies, 2015, 9(1): 67–81.] highlighted the intertwining of different modalities in multimodal discourse, working collaboratively to construct meaning.

The translation of video subtitles represents one of the extensively studied aspects of multimodal translation. Researchers in this domain commonly agree that multimodal elements like images, audio, and videos impact the source text, consequently influencing the translation process. For instance, Yi Jing^[JING Y. Independent versus latched interjections: Co-textual differences and their expendability in film subtitling[J]. Lingua, 2021, 254: 103053.] explored the translation of video subtitles, focusing on the nuanced decision-making process regarding the inclusion of self-expressive interjections. The research revealed that the determination to maintain such interjections in subtitle translation relied not solely on textual factors, considering the linguistic level of the interjection in a sentence. It also took into account audio aspects, with no necessity for interjection translation if it merely described the sound's phonetics. Additionally, the study considered visual elements, where concurrent facial expressions and bodily gestures might convey similar or commensurate meanings.

This paper will apply a similar conceptual framework to assess the quality of multimodal translation in science museums in Beijing. To ensure objectivity,

## Translation of Interactivity

Although the term "interactivity" might appear to be a recent concept primarily associated with computer technology, its roots are neither novel nor confined solely to digital media. This term has previously been employed to convey that recipients wield the capability to shape their encounter with a specific product or service and its outcome.

The disintegration of interactive text stands as a pivotal concern in the localization of MIES and the internationalization of science museums. As noted by Pym^[PYM A. What technology does to translating[J]. The International Journal of Translation and Interpreting Research, 2011, 3: 1–9.], technology disrupts linearity, a disruption that becomes particularly conspicuous in our interactions with websites. This disruption shifts the emphasis away from linearity and towards the technological facets of communication, occasionally obscuring the human element intrinsic to the process of translation.

# Methodology

<section>

This chapter consists of two distinct sections: data collection and internationalization analysis. The data collection section outlines the methodology employed and specifies the timeframe during which the data were gathered. Conversely, the internationalization analysis section provides a detailed explanation of the analytical approach used and clarifies the rationale behind selecting these particular methods.

## Data Collection

The data collection process began with on-site visits to the China Science and Technology Museum, a hub of knowledge and innovation located in Beijing. Equipped with high-resolution cameras, the researcher embarked on a comprehensive exploration of the museum's exhibits, capturing a diverse range of English and Chinese textual content displayed on plaques, informational boards, and interactive displays.

Following the photographic documentation phase, the subsequent step involved converting these images into machine-readable text using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology. By leveraging advanced OCR algorithms, the textual content embedded within the photographed exhibits was transcribed into digital format, thereby facilitating further analysis and processing.

However, recognizing the inherent limitations of OCR technology, a thorough manual verification process was undertaken to rectify any inaccuracies or discrepancies within the transcribed textual data. This critical verification phase entailed meticulously scrutinizing each transcribed document for errors or mistranscriptions, ensuring the integrity and accuracy of the resulting dataset. The researcher personally conducted this verification task, meticulously cross-referencing the transcribed text with the original images to rectify any inconsistencies.

The integration of manual and technological methodologies within the data collection process at the China Science and Technology Museum represents a paradigmatic approach to acquiring bilingual translation pairs. By harmonizing physical exploration with state-of-the-art OCR technology and meticulous manual verification, the resulting dataset serves as a testament to the precision and rigor demonstrated in linguistic research and language processing.

## Quality Assessment Methods

This study employs a set of predefined standards to analyze the quality of internationalization in science museums located in Beijing. An inherent limitation of this analytical approach is the significant influence of the selected standards on the evaluation outcomes. Herein, standards endorsed by Chinese authorities are regarded as authoritative, while alternative standards are cautiously selected, recognizing the inherent imperfections of any single standard. Despite this notable constraint, standards offer advantages, particularly in terms of objectivity.

In the domain of machine translation research, quality assessment frequently relies on standardized metrics such as BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy). BLEU evaluates the quality of text translated by machines from one natural language to another. The fundamental principle of BLEU is that the closer a machine translation aligns with a professional human translation, the higher its quality—a principle reflecting the core concept of this metric[^Papineni2002]. Developed at IBM in 2001, BLEU was one of the pioneering metrics demonstrating a strong correlation with human quality judgments and remains one of the most widely utilized automated and cost-effective metrics in the field[^Papineni2002][^Coughlin2003].

BLEU scores are calculated for individual translated segments, typically sentences, by comparing them with a set of high-quality reference translations. These scores are then averaged across the entire corpus to provide an overall estimate of translation quality. It is important to note that BLEU does not consider factors such as intelligibility or grammatical correctness[^Papineni2002].

The BLEU metric generates scores ranging from 0 to 1, indicating the similarity between the machine-translated text and the reference texts, with values closer to 1 representing higher similarity. Human translations rarely achieve a score of 1, as this would suggest identity with one of the reference translations. Hence, a score of 1 is not necessarily a target. Furthermore, incorporating additional reference translations can elevate BLEU scores due to increased matching opportunities[^Papineni2002].

Although human-translated text may not always serve as the optimal benchmark, potentially leading to less accurate assessment outcomes, this standardized approach ensures fairness. In cases where one entity receives an inflated score, others under similar conditions are similarly impacted.

Taking into account these considerations, this paper adopts a standardized approach to evaluate the quality of internationalization to ensure objectivity. All standards will be delineated before each quality assessment. For further elaboration, refer to the chapter on Quality Assessment Results.

## Writing English

Standards governing spelling, hyphenation, capitalization, word breaks, emphasis, punctuation, and related aspects are widespread and crucial. The pivotal question revolves around determining the most widely acknowledged standard amidst potential conflicts inherent in various rule sources.

As an illustrative case, the German language underwent orthographic reform in 1996 (Reform der deutschen Rechtschreibung von 1996), resulting from an international agreement signed in Vienna in July 1996 by the governments of German-speaking countries, including Germany, Austria, Liechtenstein, and Switzerland. This reform established the official orthography for adjudicating correct sentence structures. While German-speaking countries' governments do not mandate an official dictionary, the Duden serves as the most widely acknowledged primary reference resource and an "unofficial authority" for German vocabulary^[German localization style guide - download center[EB/OL]. deu-deu-StyleGuide.pdf, Microsoft[2024-05-03]. https://download.microsoft.com/download/e/f/9/ef9f6d8e-cd8b-420c-8696-afd98b4a367d/deu-deu-StyleGuide.pdf.].

In contrast to German, English orthographic reforms lack systematicity or widespread acknowledgment. When assessing the quality of English translations in Beijing's science museums, it becomes crucial to determine a widely accepted standard. In this context, I propose adopting the _English Style Guide_^[English style guide[EB/OL]. eng-gbr-StyleGuide.pdf, European Commission, 2023-11-14. (2023-11-14)[2024-01-04]. https://commission.europa.eu/system/files/2023-11/styleguide_english_dgt_en.pdf.] from the European Commission as the benchmark. Let's explore the rationale behind this choice.

Firstly, the _English Style Guide_ ensures language consistency. Beijing's science museums employ both American English and Irish/British English, or even more variants. While it's acceptable to use any English style, mixing multiple styles within the same context can lead to confusion. Therefore, employing the European Commission's guide, which follows Irish/British English, is appropriate. By adhering to this shared linguistic framework, we ensure consistency across all translated materials, offering visitors a seamless experience throughout the exhibits.

Secondly, the European Union boasts some of the world's leading language specialists, evidenced by initiatives like the CEFR. The Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR), originating from the European Union, stands as one of the most respected language evaluation systems globally. Aligning our standards with the European Commission's guide harmonizes our approach with the CEFR's rigorous criteria, thereby enhancing the quality of translations and reflecting our commitment to excellence.

Thirdly, the European Commission's _English Style Guide_ enjoys widespread recognition within the European Union. As an institution dedicated to promoting effective communication, the EU endorses this guide as a reliable resource. By adopting it, we tap into a well-established framework that resonates with international audiences.

Fourthly, the guide's accessibility and open-source nature are noteworthy. Its freely accessible nature ensures that translators, editors, and content creators worldwide can consult it without barriers, fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing. Utilizing an open-source document contributes to a global network of language enthusiasts striving for clarity and precision.

Fifthly, the _English Style Guide_ supplements its recommendations by referencing various other acknowledged standards, such as the _New Oxford Dictionary for Writers and Editors_. By drawing from multiple reputable sources, we create a comprehensive toolkit for language professionals, ensuring that translations meet high standards of correctness and readability.

In conclusion, adopting the European Commission's _English Style Guide_ empowers us to rigorously assess English translations in Beijing's science museums. Prioritizing consistency, aligning with renowned evaluation systems, leveraging EU recognition, embracing accessibility, and referencing established standards collectively elevate the quality of communication within these cultural institutions. As visitors explore the exhibits, they encounter not only scientific wonders but also linguistic excellence—a testament to our dedication to effective cross-cultural communication.

### Punctuation

This chapter endeavors to elucidate punctuation-related errors present in translations within science museums in Beijing. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of these translations and compiled a catalogue of recurring errors that could potentially impede comprehension and detract from the visitor experience.

The primary error type identified is the misuse of commas within clauses, which occurred 13 times in our translation corpus. Such misapplications of commas within clauses can result in ambiguity and confusion. For instance, in describing the Han Dynasty's iron smelting technology, a sentence reads: "... not only saved human and animal power, but also improved blast capacity and boosted the development of iron smelting technology." Here, the comma preceding "but also" disrupts the flow of the correlative conjunction "not only...but also." Eliminating this comma would enhance sentence clarity, ensuring the relationship between the two clauses is understood.

The second type of error involves superfluous punctuation in compound or complex sentences, identified once in our translation corpus. While compound and complex sentences are essential for conveying detailed information succinctly, incorrect punctuation can obscure intended meanings. Consider the following sentence: "Its principle was to ensure stable water quantity in the star pot via a multi-stage water clock, so that the water pressure was stable and the flow velocity unchanged." The comma preceding the dependent clause "so that ..." is unnecessary. In complex sentences, a comma is required only when the dependent clause precedes the independent clause. Removing this comma would align the sentence with proper grammatical conventions.

The third error type concerns closing punctuation, noted once in our translation corpus. Proper closing punctuation signifies the end of a thought or statement. An example of incorrect closing punctuation is found in the sentence: "The first record of using the compass in Europe was found in 1190 A.D.." The double full stops at the end of the sentence is redundant. The correct approach would be to use a single full stop, even when the sentence concludes with an abbreviation.

The fourth type of error concerns the omission of a full stop, which was identified eight times in our translation corpus. The absence of a full stop at the end of a sentence can disrupt the reader's rhythm and cause stumbling. For example, in the sentence, "The exhibit is a 1:3 miniature copy of the gnomon of Purple Hills," which concludes a paragraph, the lack of a full stop can impede comprehension and disrupt the text's flow. This omission, especially when noted at the paragraph's conclusion, highlights the importance of maintaining proper punctuation. Importantly, this type of mistake is easily avoidable and should not occur with such frequency. When considered alongside other findings, these errors likely arise from manual copying and pasting, a topic we will delve into further in the Discussion and Suggestions chapter.

Additionally, we encountered some mistakes likely caused by accidents, such as the double semicolon in the sentence: "Shen Kuo, a scientist in the Northern Song Dynasty, made a record in _Mengxi Bitan_:: 'If you want to ...'" or "etc" without a full stop while another "etc" next to it has one. These errors will not be counted.

In conclusion, the precision of punctuation is not merely a matter of grammatical pedantry but a cornerstone of clear communication. In science museums, where education and accuracy are paramount, attention to such details is essential. By rectifying these punctuation errors, the museums in Beijing will not only improve the visitor experience but also uphold the standards of scientific dissemination.

### Spelling

In this chapter, we explore the intricacies of misspellings. Our translation corpus, sourced from science museums in Beijing, has uncovered a total of 95 misspelled words, which can be roughly categorized into four types.

The first category of spelling errors involves the unexplained use of Chinese pinyin. Instances such as 'qiandu' for 壍堵, 'yangma' for 阳马, and 'bienao' for 鳖臑 are perplexing without context. These transliterations, while phonetically accurate, fail to convey meaning to those unfamiliar with Chinese characters. This raises questions about the effectiveness of such translations in an educational setting, where comprehension is key. Furthermore, without capitalization or italics, these words are regarded as misspelled in this paper.

The second type of error arises from the use of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology. Words like "northem" instead of "northern," "Provinse" in place of "Province," and "lron" for "iron" highlight the limitations of OCR. While there is no overt reason for the museums to use OCRed text, the rationale behind OCR employment in translation will be further discussed in the Discussion and Suggestions chapter.

The third type of error is the inconsistent use of British English and other English dialects. This is evident in words such as "color" and "colour," "enameling" and "enamelling," as well as "neighboring" and "neighbouring." The mixture of dialects can lead to confusion and detracts from the professionalism expected in such scholarly environments.

Lastly, the fourth and final category encompasses common mistakes such as "metallographical" instead of "metallographic," "acupunction" rather than "acupuncture," and "casted" instead of "cast." These errors may stem from typographical oversight or a lack of familiarity with the correct terminology, emphasizing the importance of thorough proofreading and linguistic expertise in translation efforts.

Based on the discussion above, it becomes apparent that there are multiple reasons for misspelling, thus necessitating multiple methods to deal with them. The solutions or suggestions will be discussed later.
