# Introduction

<section>

Derived from the progress of multimedia interactive entertainment software (MIES), the concept of internationalization is introduced to the field of translation. Internationalization, a superset of translation, encompasses various elements, including translation itself and aspects such as multimedia and interactivity. This broader perspective significantly influences the development of translation studies. This paper aims to apply certain MIES internationalization theories and practices to a domain beyond MIES, specifically addressing translation or internationalization issues within science museums in Beijing. From this novel viewpoint, this identifies errors in the English internationalization in science museums in Beijing, ranging from traditional concerns like incorrect spelling, punctuation, and grammar to MIES-specific problems such as inappropriate typography and the absence of multimedia translation.

## Research Background

This study is contextualized by two pivotal factors: the rapidly expanding MIES industry (as well as its internationalization industry) and the increasing significance of science museums in Beijing. Subsequently, this chapter will delineate each of these factors individually.

### MIES Internationalization

Historically, Translation Studies have primarily focused on textual analysis, neglecting the dynamic nature of intercultural communication. With the rise of digital technology, translation has evolved to encompass multimedia and interactive entertainment products, particularly MIES. As has been previously discussed by Bernal-Merino^[MERINO M B. On the Translation of Video Games[J]. The Journal of Specialised Translation, 2006. ], MIES combines in one product characteristics of other arts and disciplines such as film, literature, 3-D design, and computer programming and provides multimedia and unparalleled interactivity, challenging traditional translation paradigms.

Translation, traditionally concerned with words, now extends beyond mere linguistic representation. The global phenomenon of MIES, exemplified by titles like _Dying Light 2 Stay Human_, underscores how interactivity can shape the narrative, adapting to public reactions. The internationalization process, covering globalization, internationalization, localization, and translation (GILT), is pivotal for the success of MIES in international markets.

Interactivity, not confined to digital media, has existed in various forms of entertainment like drama and literature. For instance, Julio Cortázar's novel _Rayuela_ challenges conventional narrative structures, and game books like the _Fighting Fantasy_ series offer readers choices impacting the story. MIES elevate interactivity, enabling users to directly control their avatars and the narrative.

Language plays a crucial role in MIES interactivity, involving users in dialogues and providing feedback through multimedia like text, audio, or video. Translation must capture the nuances of these exchanges, ensuring the immersive experience of MIES transcends language barriers. Achieving this requires linguistic flexibility, adherence to syntactical and morphological rules, and cultural sensitivity to maintain user immersion.

Internationalization surpasses mere translation; it tailors a MIES to the cultural, legal, and technical needs of its target audience. Playability, ease, and enjoyment of using an MIES, directly hinges on the quality of internationalization. Errors in gender, number agreement, or mode of address can compromise user experience. Meticulous internationalization is essential to ensure the coherence and engagement of the MIES's narrative and mechanics in all languages.

MIES marks a new frontier in translation studies, where interactivity and internationalization assume paramount importance. Preserving the interactive essence of MIES while adapting them to diverse linguistic and cultural contexts poses a challenge. As MIES continues to evolve, the field of translation must also evolve, embracing the complexities of intercultural communication and the creative possibilities of interactive storytelling.

### Science Museums in Beijing

In an era characterized by globalization and the pervasive influence of information technology, science museums have emerged as pivotal contributors to the dissemination of scientific knowledge and cultural exchange. Beijing, serving as the capital of China, stands at the forefront of this transformative movement, hosting an array of science museums that cater to both local and international audiences. The significance of English internationalization within these institutions cannot be overstated, as it not only facilitates cross-cultural communication but also amplifies the global impact of Beijing's science education endeavors.

The imperative of English internationalization is accentuated by the surge in inbound tourism in China. Since the initiation of reforms and opening up, China's inbound tourism industry has witnessed unprecedented growth. According to data from the National Bureau of Statistics, between 1978 and 2019, the number of inbound tourists in China increased nearly 140-fold. Consequently, China has ascended to become the world's fourth-largest inbound tourism destination, trailing only France, Spain, and the United States^[World Tourism Organization. (2023). Global and regional tourism performance [Database]. Madrid, Spain: World Tourism Organization.]. As the focal point of China, Beijing annually attracts over 60 million international tourists, solidifying its status as the country's premier destination.

The rapid evolution of China's science communication sector has led to the establishment of diverse science museums nationwide, each adhering to modern principles of scientific center construction. These museums employ thematic and comprehensive classification methods, fostering audience participation and interactive experiences. As these museums expand, their involvement in international affairs increases, with engagements spanning organizations such as the Science Centre World Congress (SCWC), the Association of Science and Technology Centers (ASTC), the Asia Pacific Network of Science and Technology Centres (ASPAC), the European Network of Science Centres and Museums (Ecsite), among others^[杨玉娟.浅谈完形理论在科技馆翻译中的运用[J].牡丹江教育学院学报,2014(05):40-41.]. Precise conveyance of professional information and terminology in English is pivotal for these interactions, underscoring the necessity for advanced research in English internationalization.

The "Belt and Road" initiative (BRI), spearheaded by China, further underscores the importance of English internationalization. In 2017, the China Science and Technology Museum (CSTM) hosted the inaugural International Symposium on The Development of Natural Science Museums under BRI (BRISMIS). This initiative has culminated in successful exhibitions abroad, such as the "Ancient Chinese Science and Technology Exhibition" in Greece and the "China Mobile Science Museum" project in Myanmar, both receiving positive feedback from local governments and the public. In 2018, CSTM showcased six aerospace-themed exhibits at the Dome Science Center in Malaysia, marking the first instance of the CSTM's permanent exhibits venturing beyond national borders. This initiative represents a significant attempt to promote China's high-tech industries through science popularization and cooperative exchanges along the BRI countries. Moreover, CSTM provides technical and intellectual support to BRI nations. For instance, in August 2018, CSTM dispatched an expert team to Sri Lanka, earning high praise for providing technical support in infrastructure and exhibition planning for Sri Lanka's National Science Centre project^[张. 北京旅游网专访中国科技馆副馆长廖红：努力建设中国特色现代科技馆体系引领中国科普事业发展, 北京旅游网, 2018-12-07. (2018-12-07)[2024-01-05]. https://www.visitbeijing.com.cn/article/47Qkrqdf8cV.].

In conclusion, the imperative of English internationalization in Beijing's science museums is pivotal for augmenting international communication, fostering cultural exchange, and showcasing China's scientific accomplishments on a global platform. As China continues to actively participate in global scientific discourse, the significance of precise and culturally sensitive translation will only escalate, ensuring that Beijing's science museums remain accessible and captivating to visitors from across the globe.

## Research Objectives

As previously highlighted, MIES internationalization offers a novel perspective for evaluating what is conventionally termed "translation." This approach introduces two additional dimensions for evaluation: multimedia and interactivity. Recognizing certain shared characteristics between the MIES internationalization industry and science museums, both involving multimedia and interactivity, this study aims to leverage these dimensions, alongside the textual element, to assess Chinese-English translation within science museums in Beijing. To streamline the expression and distinguish it from traditional translation quality assessments, this new perspective is termed "internationalization quality assessment" in this paper.

The research objectives are twofold. Firstly, the study endeavors to identify latent errors within the internationalization of science museums in Beijing. To ensure objectivity, all assessments will adhere to widely acknowledged standards, which will be comprehensively introduced in the methodology chapter. Secondly, the research aims to delve into the root causes of these identified mistakes and subsequently provide insightful solutions to prevent their recurrence. This dual-pronged approach contributes practical strategies for elevating the quality of Chinese-English translations in the context of science museums in Beijing.

## Research Significance

This research holds significance in its potential to elevate internationalization practices within science museums in Beijing, thereby enhancing the visitor experience for a global audience. By applying MIES internationalization theories to the context of science museums, this study aims to bridge the gap between evolving translation studies and the practical needs of cultural institutions in the digital age.

### Advancing Translation Studies

This research contributes to the academic discourse by broadening the scope of translation studies to encompass multimedia and interactivity as crucial components. It challenges conventional translation paradigms by illustrating the significance of cultural and contextual adaptability within MIES, a concept extendable to other interactive and multimedia content within museums.

### Cultural Exchange and Diplomacy

As Beijing's science museums increasingly participate in international collaborations and cultural diplomacy, the quality of English internationalization emerges as a pivotal factor in effective communication. The findings of this study will be pivotal in refining the museums' internationalization strategies, thereby facilitating a deeper appreciation of Chinese scientific accomplishments and cultural heritage among international visitors.

### Methodological Innovation

Lastly, this research signifies methodological innovation by devising an internationalization quality assessment framework for traditional translation, drawing inspiration from best practices in the well-established MISE industry. This initiative aims to modernize and enhance the efficiency and accuracy of the traditional translation industry.

In summary, this research not only addresses the immediate need to enhance internationalization practices within Beijing's science museums but also contributes to broader academic discussions within translation studies. By advocating for a more inclusive approach that embraces multimedia and interactivity, it sets a precedent for future research in this field. Furthermore, its implications extend beyond the academic realm, offering practical insights for cultural institutions navigating the complexities of international collaboration and communication. Ultimately, this study strives to foster mutual understanding and appreciation across cultures, thereby enriching the global discourse on science and cultural heritage.

# Literature and Practice Review

<section>

As highlighted earlier, this study delves into three dimensions of internationalization: text, multimedia, and interactivity. This chapter will provide a concise introduction to each of these aspects.

## Translation of Text

Among the three dimensions under consideration, text translation stands out as the most extensively studied field due to the historical prominence of text as a medium for information exchange. Within the context of internationalization in science museums, a seminal theory is a linguistic landscape introduced by Landry and Bourhis^[LANDRY R, BOURHIS R Y. Linguistic Landscape and ethnolinguistic vitality[J]. Journal of Language and Social Psychology, 1997, 16(1): 23–49.]. This theory defines linguistic landscape as the language present on public signs, encompassing road signs, billboards, street names, place names, shop signs, and public building signs within a defined territory, region, or city group. Widely cited, this definition is considered a classic in the field, with other scholars emphasizing the public space as the foundational backdrop of the linguistic landscape. For example, Ben-Rafael^[BEN-RAFAEL E. A sociological approach to the study of Linguistic Landscapes[J]. Linguistic Landscape, 2008: 48–62.] employs the concept of the "public sphere" proposed by German sociologist Habermas to describe the public spaces where signs are present.

In the domain of analyzing errors in Chinese-English translation using linguistic landscape theory, scholars have frequently highlighted the issue of **consistency**. For instance, Tian Feiyang and Zhang Weijia^[田飞洋, 张维佳. 全球化社会语言学:语言景观研究的新理论——以北京市学院路双语公示语为例[J]. 语言文字应用, 2014(02):38-45. DOI:10.16499/j.cnki.1003-5397.2014.02.005.] identified discrepancies such as "QINGHUA East Rd" and "QINGHUA DONGLU" being two English names for the same road, potentially confusing for foreigners. Given the widespread use of Pinyin in China, this issue is prevalent. Another example comes from Qiu Ying^[邱莹. 上饶市语言景观调查研究[J]. 语言文字应用, 2016(03):40-49. DOI:10.16499/j.cnki.1003-5397.2016.03.005.], who found common mix-ups like "LU" and "RD," "DADAO" and "AVENUE," and "SHAN" and "MT" in Shangrao city. This paper will similarly analyze consistency in the internationalization of science museums in Beijing, given its objectivity and significance.

Another frequently cited concern is proficiency in **writing English**. Sun Li's research^[孙利. 语言景观翻译的现状及其交际翻译策略[J]. 江西师范大学学报(哲学社会科学版), 2009, 42(06):153-156.] identified errors ranging from incorrect spelling, such as "China Psot" instead of "China Post," to incorrect meaning, like interpreting "watering place" as "drinking water," and grammar mistakes, for instance, "PLEASE WELL KEPT YOUR PASSWORD" instead of "Please keep your PIN number safe." A common shortcoming in papers addressing English writing errors is the absence of a standard. While it is widely known that "Psot" is misspelled in English-speaking regions, this may not suffice for more complex situations. This paper will scrutinize English writing in the internationalization of science museums in Beijing, providing standards and rationale for their selection. Further details can be found in the methodology chapter.

Some scholars have also raised concerns about **style and tone**. In the research conducted by Ding Rongrong^[丁容容. 全球化与旅游景点公共标识语翻译研究[J]. 黎明职业大学学报, 2010(04):82-86. DOI:10.13446/j.cnki.jlvu.000907.], concerns were raised about the use of terms such as "old," "disabled," and "pregnant" in public spaces, deeming them sensitive and inappropriate. However, it is important to note that this perspective may lack objectivity. For instance, Ding Rongrong proposes replacing the directive "SUNDRIES PROHIBIT" with a milder expression like "PLEASE DON'T LITTER," advocating for a more considerate tone. Nevertheless, this argument falls short as it fails to offer a systematic method for determining which words, under specific circumstances, might be considered too harsh or inappropriate. In this study, open-source language models are employed to assess the sentiment and formality of text within science museums in Beijing. This evaluation aims to determine the appropriateness of language use while maintaining objectivity, as detailed in the methodology chapter.

## Translation of Multimedia

In this section, the focus shifts to the translation of multimedia, considering **typography** as an integral component. Typography, being more of a practical concern than a theoretical one, has received limited attention in academic literature. Notably, the field of web typography, guided by Google, the developer of the widely used Chrome browser, has provided normative guidelines for web typography. This paper will utilize Google's normative guides to analyze the typography employed in science museums in Beijing, excluding subjective informative guides. Further details will be presented in the methodology chapter.

In traditional translation studies, multimedia translation was commonly referred to as **multimodal** translation. Addressing this, Kress^[KRESS G R, LEEUWEN T V. Reading images: The grammar of visual design[M]. 3rd ed. London: Routledge, Taylor & Francis Group, 2021.] argued that multimodality encompasses all channels and media involved in the communicative process, including resource sign systems such as colors, images, and music, in addition to basic linguistic symbols. Ketola^[KETOLA A. Towards a multimodally oriented theory of translation: A cognitive framework for the translation of illustrated technical texts[J]. Translation Studies, 2015, 9(1): 67–81.] highlighted the intertwining of different modalities in multimodal discourse, working collaboratively to construct meaning.

The translation of video subtitles represents one of the extensively studied aspects of multimodal translation. Researchers in this domain commonly agree that multimodal elements like images, audio, and videos impact the source text, consequently influencing the translation process. For instance, Yi Jing^[JING Y. Independent versus latched interjections: Co-textual differences and their expendability in film subtitling[J]. Lingua, 2021, 254: 103053.] explored the translation of video subtitles, focusing on the nuanced decision-making process regarding the inclusion of self-expressive interjections. The research revealed that the determination to maintain such interjections in subtitle translation relied not solely on textual factors, considering the linguistic level of the interjection in a sentence. It also took into account audio aspects, with no necessity for interjection translation if it merely described the sound's phonetics. Additionally, the study considered visual elements, where concurrent facial expressions and bodily gestures might convey similar or commensurate meanings.

This study will employ a comparable conceptual framework to evaluate the efficacy of multimodal translation within science museums situated in Beijing. Given the absence of a universally recognized standard for assessing multimodal translation, our analysis will focus solely on the objective evaluation of the five dimensions of multimodal translation as outlined by Qian^[钱绍昌.影视翻译──翻译园地中愈来愈重要的领域[J].中国翻译,2000,(01):61-65.], which include auditory, comprehensive, instantaneous, colloquial, and non-annotation aspects.

## Translation of Interactivity

Although the term "interactivity" might appear to be a recent concept primarily associated with computer technology, its roots are neither novel nor confined solely to digital media. This term has previously been employed to convey that recipients wield the capability to shape their encounter with a specific product or service and its outcome.

The disintegration of interactive text stands as a pivotal concern in the localization of MIES and the internationalization of science museums. As noted by Pym^[PYM A. What technology does to translating[J]. The International Journal of Translation and Interpreting Research, 2011, 3: 1–9.], technology disrupts linearity, a disruption that becomes particularly conspicuous in our interactions with websites. This disruption shifts the emphasis away from linearity and towards the technological facets of communication, occasionally obscuring the human element intrinsic to the process of translation.

Given the relatively limited scope of relevant studies, this paper will solely concentrate on the presence and consistency of interactive translation.

# Methodology

<section>

This chapter consists of two distinct sections: data collection and internationalization analysis. The data collection section outlines the methodology employed and specifies the timeframe during which the data were gathered. Conversely, the internationalization analysis section provides a detailed explanation of the analytical approach used and clarifies the rationale behind selecting these particular methods.

## Data Collection

The data collection process began with on-site visits to the China Science and Technology Museum, a hub of knowledge and innovation located in Beijing. Equipped with high-resolution cameras, the researcher embarked on a comprehensive exploration of the museum's exhibits, capturing a diverse range of English and Chinese textual content displayed on plaques, informational boards, and interactive displays.

Following the photographic documentation phase, the subsequent step involved converting these images into machine-readable text using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology. By leveraging advanced OCR algorithms, the textual content embedded within the photographed exhibits was transcribed into digital format, thereby facilitating further analysis and processing.

However, recognizing the inherent limitations of OCR technology, a thorough manual verification process was undertaken to rectify any inaccuracies or discrepancies within the transcribed textual data. This critical verification phase entailed meticulously scrutinizing each transcribed document for errors or mistranscriptions, ensuring the integrity and accuracy of the resulting dataset. The researcher personally conducted this verification task, meticulously cross-referencing the transcribed text with the original images to rectify any inconsistencies.

The integration of manual and technological methodologies within the data collection process at the China Science and Technology Museum represents a paradigmatic approach to acquiring bilingual translation pairs. By harmonizing physical exploration with state-of-the-art OCR technology and meticulous manual verification, the resulting dataset serves as a testament to the precision and rigor demonstrated in linguistic research and language processing.

The translation pair data can be found at https://xiaosong-cpe.github.io/paper/translation-pair.

## Quality Assessment Methods

This study employs a set of predefined standards to analyze the quality of internationalization in science museums located in Beijing. An inherent limitation of this analytical approach is the significant influence of the selected standards on the evaluation outcomes. Herein, standards endorsed by Chinese authorities are regarded as authoritative, while alternative standards are cautiously selected, recognizing the inherent imperfections of any single standard. Despite this notable constraint, standards offer advantages, particularly in terms of objectivity.

In the domain of machine translation research, quality assessment frequently relies on standardized metrics such as BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy). BLEU evaluates the quality of text translated by machines from one natural language to another. The fundamental principle of BLEU is that the closer a machine translation aligns with a professional human translation, the higher its quality—a principle reflecting the core concept of this metric[^Papineni2002]. Developed at IBM in 2001, BLEU was one of the pioneering metrics demonstrating a strong correlation with human quality judgments and remains one of the most widely utilized automated and cost-effective metrics in the field[^Papineni2002][^Coughlin2003].

BLEU scores are calculated for individual translated segments, typically sentences, by comparing them with a set of high-quality reference translations. These scores are then averaged across the entire corpus to provide an overall estimate of translation quality. It is important to note that BLEU does not consider factors such as intelligibility or grammatical correctness[^Papineni2002].

The BLEU metric generates scores ranging from 0 to 1, indicating the similarity between the machine-translated text and the reference texts, with values closer to 1 representing higher similarity. Human translations rarely achieve a score of 1, as this would suggest identity with one of the reference translations. Hence, a score of 1 is not necessarily a target. Furthermore, incorporating additional reference translations can elevate BLEU scores due to increased matching opportunities[^Papineni2002].

Although human-translated text may not always serve as the optimal benchmark, potentially leading to less accurate assessment outcomes, this standardized approach ensures fairness. In cases where one entity receives an inflated score, others under similar conditions are similarly impacted.

Taking into account these considerations, this paper adopts a standardized approach to evaluate the quality of internationalization to ensure objectivity. All standards will be delineated before each quality assessment. For further elaboration, refer to the chapter on Quality Assessment Results.

# Quality Assessment Results

<section>

This section will assess the English quality within the Science Museum according to the following seven aspects: writing English, typography, consistency, style & tone, multimodal and interactivity. Each subchapter will provide a brief introduction, explain the assessment methods in detail and present the assessment results.

## Writing English

Standards governing punctuation, spelling, capitalization, hyphenation, and related aspects are widespread and crucial. The pivotal question revolves around determining the most widely acknowledged standard amidst potential conflicts inherent in various rule sources.

As an illustrative case, the German language underwent orthographic reform in 1996 (Reform der deutschen Rechtschreibung von 1996), resulting from an international agreement signed in Vienna in July 1996 by the governments of German-speaking countries, including Germany, Austria, Liechtenstein, and Switzerland. This reform established the official orthography for adjudicating correct sentence structures. While German-speaking countries' governments do not mandate an official dictionary, the Duden serves as the most widely acknowledged primary reference resource and an "unofficial authority" for German vocabulary^[German localization style guide - download center[EB/OL]. deu-deu-StyleGuide.pdf, Microsoft[2024-05-03]. https://download.microsoft.com/download/e/f/9/ef9f6d8e-cd8b-420c-8696-afd98b4a367d/deu-deu-StyleGuide.pdf.].

In contrast to German, English orthographic reforms lack systematicity or widespread acknowledgment. When assessing the quality of English translations in Beijing's science museums, it becomes crucial to determine a widely accepted standard. In this context, I propose adopting the _English Style Guide_^[English style guide[EB/OL]. eng-gbr-StyleGuide.pdf, European Commission, 2023-11-14. (2023-11-14)[2024-01-04]. https://commission.europa.eu/system/files/2023-11/styleguide_english_dgt_en.pdf.] from the European Commission as the benchmark. Let's explore the rationale behind this choice.

Firstly, the _English Style Guide_ ensures language consistency. Beijing's science museums employ both American English and Irish/British English, or even more variants. While it's acceptable to use any English style, mixing multiple styles within the same context can lead to confusion. Therefore, employing the European Commission's guide, which follows Irish/British English, is appropriate. By adhering to this shared linguistic framework, we ensure consistency across all translated materials, offering visitors a seamless experience throughout the exhibits.

Secondly, the European Union boasts some of the world's leading language specialists, evidenced by initiatives like the CEFR. The Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR), originating from the European Union, stands as one of the most respected language evaluation systems globally. Aligning our standards with the European Commission's guide harmonizes our approach with the CEFR's rigorous criteria, thereby enhancing the quality of translations and reflecting our commitment to excellence.

Thirdly, the European Commission's _English Style Guide_ enjoys widespread recognition within the European Union. As an institution dedicated to promoting effective communication, the EU endorses this guide as a reliable resource. By adopting it, we tap into a well-established framework that resonates with international audiences.

Fourthly, the guide's accessibility and open-source nature are noteworthy. Its freely accessible nature ensures that translators, editors, and content creators worldwide can consult it without barriers, fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing. Utilizing an open-source document contributes to a global network of language enthusiasts striving for clarity and precision.

Fifthly, the _English Style Guide_ supplements its recommendations by referencing various other acknowledged standards, such as the _New Oxford Dictionary for Writers and Editors_. By drawing from multiple reputable sources, we create a comprehensive toolkit for language professionals, ensuring that translations meet high standards of correctness and readability.

In conclusion, adopting the European Commission's _English Style Guide_ empowers us to rigorously assess English translations in Beijing's science museums. Prioritizing consistency, aligning with renowned evaluation systems, leveraging EU recognition, embracing accessibility, and referencing established standards collectively elevate the quality of communication within these cultural institutions. As visitors explore the exhibits, they encounter not only scientific wonders but also linguistic excellence—a testament to our dedication to effective cross-cultural communication.

### Punctuation

This chapter endeavors to elucidate punctuation-related errors present in translations within science museums in Beijing. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of these translations and compiled a catalogue of recurring errors that could potentially impede comprehension and detract from the visitor experience.

The primary error type identified is the misuse of commas within clauses, which occurred 13 times in our translation corpus. Such misapplications of commas within clauses can result in ambiguity and confusion. For instance, in describing the Han Dynasty's iron smelting technology, a sentence reads: "... not only saved human and animal power, but also improved blast capacity and boosted the development of iron smelting technology." Here, the comma preceding "but also" disrupts the flow of the correlative conjunction "not only...but also." Eliminating this comma would enhance sentence clarity, ensuring the relationship between the two clauses is understood.

The second type of error involves superfluous punctuation in compound or complex sentences, identified once in our translation corpus. While compound and complex sentences are essential for conveying detailed information succinctly, incorrect punctuation can obscure intended meanings. Consider the following sentence: "Its principle was to ensure stable water quantity in the star pot via a multi-stage water clock, so that the water pressure was stable and the flow velocity unchanged." The comma preceding the dependent clause "so that ..." is unnecessary. In complex sentences, a comma is required only when the dependent clause precedes the independent clause. Removing this comma would align the sentence with proper grammatical conventions.

The third error type concerns closing punctuation, noted once in our translation corpus. Proper closing punctuation signifies the end of a thought or statement. An example of incorrect closing punctuation is found in the sentence: "The first record of using the compass in Europe was found in 1190 A.D.." The double full stops at the end of the sentence is redundant. The correct approach would be to use a single full stop, even when the sentence concludes with an abbreviation.

The fourth type of error concerns the omission of a full stop, which was identified eight times in our translation corpus. The absence of a full stop at the end of a sentence can disrupt the reader's rhythm and cause stumbling. For example, in the sentence, "The exhibit is a 1:3 miniature copy of the gnomon of Purple Hills," which concludes a paragraph, the lack of a full stop can impede comprehension and disrupt the text's flow. This omission, especially when noted at the paragraph's conclusion, highlights the importance of maintaining proper punctuation. Importantly, this type of mistake is easily avoidable and should not occur with such frequency. When considered alongside other findings, these errors likely arise from manual copying and pasting, a topic we will delve into further in the Discussion and Suggestions chapter.

Additionally, we encountered some mistakes likely caused by accidents, such as the double semicolon in the sentence: "Shen Kuo, a scientist in the Northern Song Dynasty, made a record in _Mengxi Bitan_:: 'If you want to ...'" or "etc" without a full stop while another "etc" next to it has one. These errors will not be counted.

In conclusion, the precision of punctuation is not merely a matter of grammatical pedantry but a cornerstone of clear communication. In science museums, where education and accuracy are paramount, attention to such details is essential. By rectifying these punctuation errors, the museums in Beijing will not only improve the visitor experience but also uphold the standards of scientific dissemination.

### Spelling

In this chapter, we explore the intricacies of misspellings. Our translation corpus, sourced from science museums in Beijing, has uncovered a total of 95 misspelled words, which can be roughly categorized into four types.

The first category of spelling errors involves the unexplained use of Chinese pinyin. Instances such as 'qiandu' for 壍堵, 'yangma' for 阳马, and 'bienao' for 鳖臑 are perplexing without context. These transliterations, while phonetically accurate, fail to convey meaning to those unfamiliar with Chinese characters. This raises questions about the effectiveness of such translations in an educational setting, where comprehension is key. Furthermore, without capitalization or italics, these words are regarded as misspelled in this paper.

The second type of error arises from the use of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology. Words like "northem" instead of "northern," "Provinse" in place of "Province," and "lron" for "iron" highlight the limitations of OCR. While there is no overt reason for the museums to use OCRed text, the rationale behind OCR employment in translation will be further discussed in the Discussion and Suggestions chapter.

The third type of error is the inconsistent use of British English and other English dialects. This is evident in words such as "color" and "colour," "enameling" and "enamelling," as well as "neighboring" and "neighbouring." The mixture of dialects can lead to confusion and detracts from the professionalism expected in such scholarly environments.

Lastly, the fourth and final category encompasses common mistakes such as "metallographical" instead of "metallographic," "acupunction" rather than "acupuncture," and "casted" instead of "cast." These errors may stem from typographical oversight or a lack of familiarity with the correct terminology, emphasizing the importance of thorough proofreading and linguistic expertise in translation efforts.

Based on the discussion above, it becomes apparent that there are multiple reasons for misspelling, thus necessitating multiple methods to deal with them. The solutions or suggestions will be discussed later.

### Others

The rest of the mistakes are relatively difficult to categorise under any of the types of written English listed in the European Commission's _English Style Guide_, so they are shown below.

Surprisingly, instances of determiner misuse are pervasive, occurring nearly 700 times throughout the science museum. For instance, in the following sentence: "They had not only contributed for the later generations the great world-renowned inventions such as compass, papermaking technology, gunpowder, porcelain, silk, etc. but also developed and formed Chinese ancient scientific system taking the 'astronomy, mathematics, agronomy, medicine' as its representative, which had made indelible contribution to the prosperity and social development of China, as well as the progress of world civilization." three determiner errors are evident. Firstly, the definite article "the" should precede "compass," "papermaking technology," "gunpowder," "porcelain," and "silk" since they refer to specific well-known inventions. Secondly, "the" is required before "Chinese ancient scientific system" as it denotes a specific system. Thirdly, "an" should be used before "indelible contribution" as it denotes a singular, specific contribution. The comparatively lesser use of determiners in Chinese, and their reduced grammatical functions, pose a significant challenge for Chinese translators.

Incorrect verb forms are also prevalent in our corpus, occurring nearly 100 times. Verb forms pose theoretical challenges for Chinese translators due to the absence of gender, number, and case distinctions in Chinese. However, this omission in Chinese appears to alleviate the burden of memorizing two verb conjugation systems simultaneously, as seen with determiners. Various factors contribute to these errors, ranging from tense ("Peacock in ancient times known as the 'king of birds', ~~is~~ **was** an auspicious omen...") to complex predicate constructions ("In the early years of East Han Dynasty, Du Shi, Prefecture chief of Nanyang invented hydraulic bellows, which drove leather bag for blast with water wheels, not only ~~saved~~ **saving** human and animal power, but also ~~improved~~ **improving** blast capacity and boosted development of iron smelting technology.").

Besides, the European Commission's _English Style Guide_ mandates the avoidance of hyphenation altogether. Although the guide does not explicitly state the rationale behind this rule, it is not difficult to surmise the reasons. Firstly, hyphenation is subject to two conflicting principles: etymological and phonetic. Secondly, the same word may be hyphenated differently across languages (e.g., "cab-ri-o-let" in English and "ca-brio-let" in French). Lastly, the rules governing hyphenation lack both intuitiveness and regularity, often necessitating reference to a dictionary even for native speakers. In essence, hyphenation lacks a widely acknowledged standard, is prone to confusion, and is challenging to execute correctly. The science museum, like many other non-super-radical organizations, employed hyphenation conventionally. However, this practice underscored the significance of prohibiting hyphenation, as over half of the hyphens used in translations within the museum were misapplied.

Additionally, numerous other mistakes persist, such as capitalization issues ("China" vs. "china") and the absence of explanations for abbreviations (e.g., "TCM" for Traditional Chinese Medicine, perhaps). These errors collectively underscore the imperfect nature of the science museum's English writing.

Possible solutions include encouraging translators to utilize grammar assistance tools or, albeit more costly, employing native English-speaking translators, a practice long established in the MIES (Museum, Interpretation, and Exhibition Services) industry. Both solutions will be further discussed in the subsequent Discussion and Suggestions section.

## Typography

As noted earlier, this study evaluates the adherence to contemporary web typography norms in the translation of content within a science museum context. It draws upon Google's web typography guide^[Fonts knowledge[EB/OL]. Google Fonts, Google[2024-05-07]. https://fonts.google.com/knowledge.], given the shared objective of both web and the science museum to effectively convey information to their respective audiences. Google, renowned for its significant influence and prominence in setting web standards, serves as a pertinent reference point.

### Fonts

The realm of typography encompasses a rich diversity of scripts and typefaces, each imbued with its own distinctive attributes and cultural significance. A comparative examination of Chinese and English fonts reveals disparities extending beyond mere surface aesthetics, rooted deeply in the linguistic and cultural traditions of the respective languages. This chapter aims to elucidate the four principal disparities between Latin (utilized in English) and CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) fonts, assessing the appropriateness of font selection in translations within the science museum context.

**1. Full-width and Monospaced vs. Half-width and Proportional**

Among the most conspicuous discrepancies lies in the default character spacing. Latin fonts typically employ proportional spacing, whereby each character occupies only the necessary horizontal space, fostering a fluid and organic appearance in Latin text. Conversely, the majority of CJK fonts adopt a monospaced format, allocating uniform space to each character. This uniformity is particularly pronounced in Chinese and Japanese fonts, tailored to fit the full unit square, resulting in a more regimented and symmetrical aesthetic. Such a full-width approach is also deemed integral to preserving the intricate and detailed nature of the characters.

However, within the confines of the science museum, instances of font misapplication occasionally occur. While such instances may not always be pivotal, discrepancies arise when Chinese characters are integrated into Latin fonts, prompting the latter to default to CJK fonts, or when English characters are incorporated into CJK fonts, typically with no discernible alteration given that most CJK fonts encompass basic Latin letters. Nevertheless, specific characters such as apostrophes or quotation marks may vary between full-width and half-width, contingent upon the font. Whereas a half-width apostrophe may be supplemented with a half-width space to emulate a full-width apostrophe, the reverse adaptation is considerably challenging. In such instances, the incorrect font choice becomes glaringly evident.

**2. Punctuation Usage**

Punctuation conventions in CJK fonts markedly diverge from those in Latin scripts. While Latin punctuation uniformly adopts a half-width format, CJK fonts often utilize a system termed "full-width punctuation," characterized by distinct and frequently wider punctuation marks compared to their Latin counterparts. In Chinese, both systems coexist, with full-width punctuation employed for formal contexts and half-width punctuation for space conservation.

Beyond the full-width and half-width dichotomy elucidated earlier, certain cultural nuances warrant attention. For instance, the absence of hyphens, en dashes, and em dashes in Chinese script is notable. Conversely, the so-called "em dash" in Chinese consists of two consecutive em dashes, necessitated by technical constraints for accurate rendering under CJK fonts (otherwise resulting in a small space between the two em dashes). Consequently, the cultural context dictates a lack of precedent for combining two em dashes in English—a phenomenon unfortunately observed within the science museum (e.g., "Interesting Physical Test in Ancient China —— 'Paperman's Resonance' Test").

**3. Emphasis Without Italics**

In contrast to Latin fonts, which utilize italics for emphasis, CJK fonts lack this feature. While faux-italics (simulated italic effects without italic font) are occasionally employed for design purposes, genuine italics are nonexistent. Instead, alternative methods such as quotation marks, full-width brackets, and diacritical marks above letters serve as means of emphasis. Additionally, bolding and coloring are effective techniques for highlighting specific words or phrases.

An interesting reversal occurs when translating text from Chinese to English, necessitating the use of italics. The science museum has indeed adopted this practice, albeit selectively. Further exploration of this matter will be undertaken in depth within the Consistency chapter.

**4. Different Font Names**

In the domain of typography, commonly used fonts can be broadly categorized into three forms: sans-serif, serif, and monospace (which is not addressed within the science museum). Sans-serif fonts lack decorative strokes at the ends of larger strokes in characters, whereas serif fonts feature such strokes. The existence of serifs originated from technical constraints in ancient times and holds little theoretical significance in contemporary contexts. While sans-serif fonts are typically associated with modernity, serif fonts evoke a sense of classic elegance. Both font forms find relevance within the science museum, as it bridges past and future histories. However, inconsistency arises when English and Chinese fonts adopt different forms, a situation observed in a minority of translations within the museum. For example, the Chinese font used in the description of the Copper Rosefinch Lamp is Songti (宋体), a serif font, while the English description employs a sans-serif font, resulting in an incongruous juxtaposition. For inexperienced staff, distinguishing between fonts can indeed pose challenges. To facilitate comprehension for novices seeking basic information, a concise table is provided below. Further automated solutions will be explored in the Discussion and Suggestions chapter.

| Font Forms | Commonly Used Chinese Fonts                      | Commonly Used English Fonts                     |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Sans-serif | Heiti (黑体)                                     | Arial, Helvetica, Calibri, Verdana              |
| Serif      | Songti (宋体), FangSongti (仿宋体), Kaiti (楷体) | Times New Roman, Georgia, Garamond, Baskerville |

In conclusion, the disparities between CJK and Latin fonts are substantial, reflecting unique typographic traditions and linguistic structures inherent to each script. From the monospaced characteristics of CJK fonts to nuanced punctuation usage and creative emphasis techniques, these distinctions significantly influence the legibility, aesthetics, and cultural resonance of written communication. Understanding these disparities is essential not only for designers and typographers but also for the science museum to ensure accuracy, consistency, and visual appeal in their translations.

### Readability

Readability describes how comfortable it is for a person to engage with text. Three factors determine readability: The person’s unique attributes (visual acuity, disabilities, and other health factors), what the text itself says, and the typography—both the choice of typeface and how it’s used. In this chapter, we will only discuss the last point, since the first point depends on audience and the second point depends on the original Chinese text.

Most part of the science museum did good job but still two places need to be pointed out. First is the label of Instruction on the Structure of Accelerator Model, which use dark text (black) and dark background (deep purple), causing the contrast of text and background extemly low thus getting infomation from the label is not easy. Second is a label of a swing, which is located exact under the swing. There is no possible for any audience as well as my camera to get the complete infomation from the label, so obviously its readability is very low.

in conclution, typogrphy also takes a very important role in translation in the science museum. Since most of the museum's staffs are not professional in English while typography is not part of the translators' job, it necessitates an automatic method to cope with the typography issues. This automatic method will be introduced in the Discussion and Suggestions chapter.

## Consistency

Traditionally, consistency has not posed a significant challenge in the field of translation, as the volume of source text has typically been manageable for a single translator, allowing sufficient time for completion. Given that all translations within a project are typically executed by one individual, consistency in translation has generally been reliable. However, with the increasing scale of projects today, consistency has emerged as a major concern, not only in the translation of the MIES industry and science museum sectors but also in any large-scale projects. Several consistency issues have been identified within the museum context.

Firstly, there is a notable mixture of British and American English usage, as previously mentioned. While such variation may be acceptable and comprehensible in casual contexts for English speakers, within the formal or even academic atmosphere of a museum, this mixed usage may lead the audience to perceive the content as less professional or persuasive, thereby diminishing the efficacy of promoting Chinese science culture.

Secondly, inconsistencies arise in the translation of Chinese terms across different locations. For instance, the term 云锦 has been translated as "Yun Jin brocade," "Ryun Jin Brocade," and simply "Brocade" on three adjacent exhibit labels. While the Chinese labels indicate the presence of three distinct subtypes of 云锦, the English labels may erroneously convey the concept of three entirely different types of brocade. Another example is 操作指南, which is rendered with four different English translations in the museum: "Operating instructions," "Instructions," "Operation instruction," and "OPERATION GUIDE." Such inconsistency in terminology can lead to significant misunderstandings among the audience. In the MIES industry, such issues are more prevalent and severe due to the mandatory nature of text comprehension, as opposed to the optional reading typical of museum visits. Fortunately, the MIES industry has already devised solutions for addressing such situations, which can be readily integrated into traditional translation workflows. Further details will be discussed in the Discussion and Suggestions chapter.

Thirdly, inconsistencies in formatting and patterns, akin to the mixed English usage, often result in textual ambiguity and detract from the overall formality and professionalism of the text. Such inconsistencies manifest in various aspects within the museum, including the formatting of book titles (e.g., italicized _Zhou Bi Suan Jing_, capitalized Compendium of Materia Medica, quoted "The Origin of Calendar," etc.), exhibit titles (e.g., sentence-cased "Pitch pipe," uppercased "AR SCAN OF ABRIDGED ARMILLA," each-word capitalized "Ancient Herbal Medicine Shop," etc.), and numeric lists (e.g., "1. 2. 3." with spaces, "1.2.3." without spaces, or the omission of list numbers from the translation despite their presence in the Chinese source text), among others.

In conclusion, ensuring consistency in translation is paramount, particularly in contexts where professionalism, clarity, and accuracy are essential, such as in the science museum. The identified issues of language variation, inconsistent terminology, and formatting discrepancies underscore the importance of implementing rigorous translation standards and quality control measures. By addressing these concerns, organizations can enhance the effectiveness of their communication efforts and better fulfill their objectives of promoting cultural exchange and knowledge dissemination. Therefore, the Discussion and Suggestions chapter will delve into practical strategies for mitigating these challenges and optimizing translation practices within these specialized domains.

## Multimodal

Multimodal translation pertains to the translation of video, which combines human senses including listening and watching, while simulating other senses like touch remains challenging. In this chapter, we explore video translation within the context of science museums.

Our field research reveals that the majority of videos in the science museum only feature Chinese content (images, audio, subtitles, etc.). On the fourth floor, there are screens displaying short videos from Microsoft with both Chinese and English subtitles. However, as these videos serve as commercial propaganda advertisements for the company, their translations are provided by Microsoft rather than the science museum and thus will not be discussed in this paper.

Adjacent to the Microsoft videos, another bilingual subtitled video discusses analog and digital quantities. The transcription of its subtitles can be found below. Nonetheless, the overall translation quality is notably low and likely a result of machine translation. As outlined by Luo^[罗季美,李梅.机器翻译译文错误分析[J].中国翻译,2012,33(05):84-89.], common errors in machine translation include term inconsistency and mistranslation of infinitive verb structures. In this video, term inconsistency occurs multiple times, such as translating 榕哥 into "Rong brother," "Rong elder brother," and "brother rong." Additionally, mistranslation of infinitive verb structures is evident, for instance, "Yeah, got it. It's better to look for Rong." is inaccurately translated as "Well To understand or to find reliable brother rong," likely due to dual meanings present in some Chinese words.

In conclusion, the examination of multimodal translation within the science museum context underscores several key findings. While videos predominantly feature Chinese content, the presence of bilingual subtitled videos, notably those from Microsoft, adds a layer of linguistic diversity. However, the translation quality of these videos varies, with some exhibiting machine-translated inaccuracies. These findings highlight the importance of ensuring high-quality translation in multimodal environments to enhance visitor experiences and promote effective communication of scientific concepts.
