# A Study on Quality Assessment of English Internationalization in Science Museums in Beijing

[[toc]]

## 1. Introduction

Derived from the progress of multimedia interactive entertainment software (MIES), the concept of internationalization is introduced to the field of translation. Internationalization, a superset of translation, encompasses various elements, including translation itself and aspects such as multimedia and interactivity. This broader perspective significantly influences the development of translation studies. This paper aims to apply certain MIES internationalization theories and practices to a domain beyond MIES, specifically addressing translation or internationalization issues within science museums in Beijing. From this novel viewpoint, this identify errors in the English internationalization in science museums in Beijing, ranging from traditional concerns like incorrect spelling, punctuation, and grammar to MIES-specific problems such as inappropriate typography and the absence of multimedia translation.

### 1.1. Research Background

This study is contextualized by two pivotal factors: the rapidly expanding MIES industry (as well as its internationalization industry) and the increasing significance of science museums in Beijing. Subsequently, this chapter will delineate each of these factors individually.

#### 1.1.1. MIES Internationalization

Historically, Translation Studies have primarily focused on textual analysis, neglecting the dynamic nature of intercultural communication. With the rise of digital technology, translation has evolved to encompass multimedia and interactive entertainment products, particularly MIES. As has been previously discussed by Bernal-Merino^[MERINO M B. On the Translation of Video Games[J]. The Journal of Specialised Translation, 2006. ], MIES combines in one product characteristics of other arts and disciplines such as film, literature, 3-D design and computer programming and provides multimedia and unparalleled interactivity, challenging traditional translation paradigms.

Translation, traditionally concerned with words, now extends beyond mere linguistic representation. The global phenomenon of MIES, exemplified by titles like _Dying Light 2 Stay Human_, underscores how interactivity can shape the narrative, adapting to public reactions. The internationalization process, covering globalization, internationalization, localization, and translation (GILT), is pivotal for the success of MIES in international markets.

Interactivity, not confined to digital media, has existed in various forms of entertainment like drama and literature. For instance, Julio Cortázar's novel _Rayuela_ challenges conventional narrative structures, and game-books like the _Fighting Fantasy_ series offer readers choices impacting the story. MIES elevate interactivity, enabling users to directly control their avatars and the narrative.

Language plays a crucial role in MIES interactivity, involving users in dialogues and providing feedback through multimedia like text, audio, or video. Translation must capture the nuances of these exchanges, ensuring the immersive experience of MIES transcends language barriers. Achieving this requires linguistic flexibility, adherence to syntactical and morphological rules, and cultural sensitivity to maintain user immersion.

Internationalization surpasses mere translation; it tailors a MIES to the cultural, legal, and technical needs of its target audience. Playability, the ease and enjoyment of using a MIES, directly hinges on the quality of internationalization. Errors in gender, number agreement, or mode of address can compromise user experience. Meticulous internationalization is essential to ensure the coherence and engagement of the MIES's narrative and mechanics in all languages.

MIES mark a new frontier in translation studies, where interactivity and internationalization assume paramount importance. Preserving the interactive essence of MIES while adapting them to diverse linguistic and cultural contexts poses a challenge. As MIES continue to evolve, the field of translation must also evolve, embracing the complexities of intercultural communication and the creative possibilities of interactive storytelling.

#### 1.1.2. Science Museums in Beijing

In an era characterized by globalization and the pervasive influence of information technology, science museums have emerged as pivotal contributors to the dissemination of scientific knowledge and cultural exchange. Beijing, serving as the capital of China, stands at the forefront of this transformative movement, hosting an array of science museums that cater to both local and international audiences. The significance of English internationalization within these institutions cannot be overstated, as it not only facilitates cross-cultural communication but also amplifies the global impact of Beijing's science education endeavors.

The imperative of English internationalization is accentuated by the surge in inbound tourism in China. Since the initiation of reforms and opening up, China's inbound tourism industry has witnessed unprecedented growth. According to data from the National Bureau of Statistics, between 1978 and 2019, the number of inbound tourists in China increased nearly 140-fold. Consequently, China has ascended to become the world's fourth-largest inbound tourism destination, trailing only France, Spain, and the United States^[World Tourism Organization. (2023). Global and regional tourism performance [Database]. Madrid, Spain: World Tourism Organization.]. As the focal point of China, Beijing annually attracts over 60 million international tourists, solidifying its status as the country's premier destination.

The rapid evolution of China's science communication sector has led to the establishment of diverse science museums nationwide, each adhering to modern principles of scientific center construction. These museums employ thematic and comprehensive classification methods, fostering audience participation and interactive experiences. As these museums expand, their involvement in international affairs increases, with engagements spanning organizations such as the Science Centre World Congress (SCWC), the Association of Science and Technology Centers (ASTC), the Asia Pacific Network of Science and Technology Centres (ASPAC), the European Network of Science Centres and Museums (Ecsite), among others^[杨玉娟.浅谈完形理论在科技馆翻译中的运用[J].牡丹江教育学院学报,2014(05):40-41.]. Precise conveyance of professional information and terminology in English is pivotal for these interactions, underscoring the necessity for advanced research in English internationalization.

The "Belt and Road" initiative (BRI), spearheaded by China, further underscores the importance of English internationalization. In 2017, the China Science and Technology Museum (CSTM) hosted the inaugural International Symposium on The Development of Natural Science Museums under BRI (BRISMIS). This initiative has culminated in successful exhibitions abroad, such as the "Ancient Chinese Science and Technology Exhibition" in Greece and the "China Mobile Science Museum" project in Myanmar, both receiving positive feedback from local governments and the public. In 2018, CSTM showcased six aerospace-themed exhibits at the Dome Science Center in Malaysia, marking the first instance of the CSTM's permanent exhibits venturing beyond national borders. This initiative represents a significant attempt to promote China's high-tech industries through science popularization and cooperative exchanges along the BRI countries. Moreover, CSTM provides technical and intellectual support to BRI nations. For instance, in August 2018, CSTM dispatched an expert team to Sri Lanka, earning high praise for providing technical support in infrastructure and exhibition planning for Sri Lanka's National Science Centre project^[张. 北京旅游网专访中国科技馆副馆长廖红：努力建设中国特色现代科技馆体系引领中国科普事业发展, 北京旅游网, 2018-12-07. (2018-12-07)[2024-01-05]. https://www.visitbeijing.com.cn/article/47Qkrqdf8cV.].

In conclusion, the imperative of English internationalization in Beijing's science museums is pivotal for augmenting international communication, fostering cultural exchange, and showcasing China's scientific accomplishments on a global platform. As China continues to actively participate in global scientific discourse, the significance of precise and culturally sensitive translation will only escalate, ensuring that Beijing's science museums remain accessible and captivating to visitors from across the globe.

### 1.2. Research Objectives

As previously highlighted, MIES internationalization offers a novel perspective for evaluating what is conventionally termed "translation." This approach introduces two additional dimensions for evaluation: multimedia and interactivity. Recognizing certain shared characteristics between the MIES internationalization industry and science museums, both involving multimedia and interactivity, this study aims to leverage these dimensions, alongside the textual element, to assess Chinese-English translation within science museums in Beijing. To streamline the expression and distinguish it from traditional translation quality assessments, this new perspective is termed "internationalization quality assessment" in this paper.

The research objectives are twofold. Firstly, the study endeavors to identify latent errors within the internationalization of science museums in Beijing. To ensure objectivity, all assessments will adhere to widely acknowledged standards, which will be comprehensively introduced in the methodology chapter. Secondly, the research aims to delve into the root causes of these identified mistakes and subsequently provide insightful solutions to prevent their recurrence. This dual-pronged approach contributes practical strategies for elevating the quality of Chinese-English translations in the context of science museums in Beijing.

### 1.3. Research Significance

This study is completely meaningless to the adcamic circle.

## 2. Literature and Practice Review

As highlighted earlier, this study delves into three dimensions of internationalization: text, multimedia, and interactivity. This chapter will provide a concise introduction to each of these aspects.

### 2.1. Translation of Text

Among the three dimensions under consideration, text translation stands out as the most extensively studied field due to the historical prominence of text as a medium for information exchange. Within the context of internationalization in science museums, a seminal theory is the linguistic landscape introduced by Landry and Bourhis^[LANDRY R, BOURHIS R Y. Linguistic Landscape and ethnolinguistic vitality[J]. Journal of Language and Social Psychology, 1997, 16(1): 23–49.]. This theory defines linguistic landscape as the language present on public signs, encompassing road signs, billboards, street names, place names, shop signs, and public building signs within a defined territory, region, or city group. Widely cited, this definition is considered a classic in the field, with other scholars emphasizing the public space as the foundational backdrop of linguistic landscape. For example, Ben-Rafael^[BEN-RAFAEL E. A sociological approach to the study of Linguistic Landscapes[J]. Linguistic Landscape, 2008: 48–62.] employs the concept of the "public sphere" proposed by German sociologist Habermas to describe the public spaces where signs are present.

In the domain of analyzing errors in Chinese-English translation using linguistic landscape theory, scholars have frequently highlighted the issue of **consistency**. For instance, Tian Feiyang and Zhang Weijia^[田飞洋, 张维佳. 全球化社会语言学:语言景观研究的新理论——以北京市学院路双语公示语为例[J]. 语言文字应用, 2014(02):38-45. DOI:10.16499/j.cnki.1003-5397.2014.02.005.] identified discrepancies such as "QINGHUA East Rd" and "QINGHUA DONGLU" being two English names for the same road, potentially causing confusion for foreigners. Given the widespread use of Pinyin in China, this issue is prevalent. Another example comes from Qiu Ying^[邱莹. 上饶市语言景观调查研究[J]. 语言文字应用, 2016(03):40-49. DOI:10.16499/j.cnki.1003-5397.2016.03.005.], who found common mix-ups like "LU" and "RD," "DADAO" and "AVENUE," and "SHAN" and "MT" in Shangrao city. This paper will similarly analyze consistency in the internationalization of science museums in Beijing, given its objectivity and significance.

Another frequently cited concern is the proficiency in **writing English**. Sun Li's research^[孙利. 语言景观翻译的现状及其交际翻译策略[J]. 江西师范大学学报(哲学社会科学版), 2009, 42(06):153-156.] identified errors ranging from incorrect spelling, such as "China Psot" instead of "China Post," to incorrect meaning, like interpreting "watering place" as "drinking water," and grammar mistakes, for instance, "PLEASE WELL KEPT YOUR PASSWORD" instead of "Please keep your PIN number safe." A common shortcoming in papers addressing English writing errors is the absence of a standard. While it is widely known that "Psot" is misspelled in English-speaking regions, this may not suffice for more complex situations. This paper will scrutinize English writing in the internationalization of science museums in Beijing, providing standards and rationale for their selection. Further details can be found in the methodology chapter.

Some scholars have also raised concerns about **style and tone**. In the research conducted by Ding Rongrong^[丁容容. 全球化与旅游景点公共标识语翻译研究[J]. 黎明职业大学学报, 2010(04):82-86. DOI:10.13446/j.cnki.jlvu.000907.], concerns were raised about the use of terms such as "old," "disabled," and "pregnant" in public spaces, deeming them sensitive and inappropriate. However, it is important to note that this perspective may lack objectivity. For instance, Ding Rongrong proposes replacing the directive "SUNDRIES PROHIBIT" with a milder expression like "PLEASE DON'T LITTER," advocating for a more considerate tone. Nevertheless, this argument falls short as it fails to offer a systematic method for determining which words, under specific circumstances, might be considered too harsh or inappropriate. In this study, open-source language models are employed to assess the sentiment and formality of text within science museums in Beijing. This evaluation aims to determine the appropriateness of language use while maintaining objectivity, as detailed in the methodology chapter.

### 2.2. Translation of Multimedia

In this section, the focus shifts to the translation of multimedia, considering **typography** as an integral component. Typography, being more of a practical concern than a theoretical one, has received limited attention in academic literature. Notably, the field of web typography, guided by Google, the developer of the widely used Chrome browser, has provided normative guidelines for web typography. This paper will utilize Google's normative guides to analyze the typography employed in science museums in Beijing, excluding subjective informative guides. Further details will be presented in the methodology chapter.

In traditional translation studies, multimedia translation was commonly referred to as **multimodal** translation. Addressing this, Kress^[KRESS G R, LEEUWEN T V. Reading images: The grammar of visual design[M]. 3rd ed. London: Routledge, Taylor & Francis Group, 2021.] argued that multimodality encompasses all channels and media involved in the communicative process, including resource sign systems such as colors, images, and music, in addition to basic linguistic symbols. Ketola^[KETOLA A. Towards a multimodally oriented theory of translation: A cognitive framework for the translation of illustrated technical texts[J]. Translation Studies, 2015, 9(1): 67–81.] highlighted the intertwining of different modalities in multimodal discourse, working collaboratively to construct meaning.

The translation of video subtitles represents one of the extensively studied aspects of multimodal translation. Researchers in this domain commonly agree that multimodal elements like images, audios, and videos impact the source text, consequently influencing the translation process. For instance, Yi Jing^[JING Y. Independent versus latched interjections: Co-textual differences and their expendability in film subtitling[J]. Lingua, 2021, 254: 103053.] explored the translation of video subtitles, focusing on the nuanced decision-making process regarding the inclusion of self-expressive interjections. The research revealed that the determination to maintain such interjections in subtitle translation relied not solely on textual factors, considering the linguistic level of the interjection in a sentence. It also took into account audio aspects, with no necessity for interjection translation if it merely described the sound's phonetics. Additionally, the study considered visual elements, where concurrent facial expressions and bodily gestures might convey similar or commensurate meanings.

This paper will apply a similar conceptual framework to assess the quality of multimodal translation in science museums in Beijing. To ensure objectivity,

### 2.3. Translation of Interactivity

Although the term "interactivity" might appear to be a recent concept primarily associated with computer technology, its roots are neither novel nor confined solely to digital media. This term has previously been employed to convey that recipients wield the capability to shape their encounter with a specific product or service and its ultimate outcome.

The disintegration of interactive text stands as a pivotal concern in the localization of MIES and the internationalization in science museums. As noted by Pym^[PYM A. What technology does to translating[J]. The International Journal of Translation and Interpreting Research, 2011, 3: 1–9.], technology disrupts linearity, a disruption that becomes particularly conspicuous in our interactions with websites. This disruption shifts the emphasis away from linearity and towards the technological facets of communication, occasionally obscuring the human element intrinsic to the process of translation.

## 3. Methodology

This chapter comprises two distinct sections: data collection and internationalization analysis. The data collection section delineates the methodology employed and specifies the time during which the data were gathered. Conversely, the internationalization analysis section provides a detailed exposition of the analytical approach utilized and elucidates the rationale behind selecting these particular methods.

### 3.2. Internationalization Analysis

This study has selected a set of standard for analyzing the quality of internationalization in science museums in Beijing. An evident shortcoming of this analytical approach is that the quality of the selected standards will undoubtedly impact the evaluation results. In this specific context, standards recognized by China's authorities are deemed as the "truth," while others may not be as fortunate. Despite this notable limitation, standards also confer benefits, specifically objectivity. In the realm of studies on machine translation, for instance, the customary assessment of translation quality involves comparing machine-translated text to human-translated text, serving as the standard. While the latter may not always be the optimal benchmark, leading to less accurate assessment results, this standardized method ensures justice. If one object receives an inflated score, others under the same circumstances are similarly affected. Taking this into consideration, this paper adopts a standardized approach to conduct the assessment of internationalization quality, aiming to ensure objectivity.

#### 3.2.1 Writing English

Rules governing spelling, hyphenation, capitalization, word breaks, emphasis, punctuation, and other aspects are ubiquitous. The pivotal question revolves around determining the most widely acknowledged standard, given the potential conflicts inherent in various rule sources.

As an illustrative case, German underwent orthographic reform in 1996 (Reform der deutschen Rechtschreibung von 1996), stemming from an international agreement signed in Vienna in July 1996 by the German-speaking countries' governments, including Germany, Austria, Liechtenstein, and Switzerland. This reform served as the official orthography to adjudicate correct sentence structures. While governments in German-speaking countries do not mandate an official dictionary, the Duden serves as the most acknowledged primary reference resource and an "unofficial authority" for German vocabulary.

In contrast to German, English orthographic reforms lack systematicity or widespread acknowledgment. This paper adopts the _English Style Guide_^[English style guide[EB/OL]. eng-gbr-StyleGuide.pdf, European Commission, 2023-11-14. (2023-11-14)[2024-01-04]. https://commission.europa.eu/system/files/2023-11/styleguide_english_dgt_en.pdf.] from the European Commission as the standard for English writing. This choice is grounded in several considerations:

- Both the guide and science museums in Beijing employ Irish/British English.
- The Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR), one of the most renowned language evaluation systems, originates from the European Union.
- The guide enjoys widespread acknowledgment within the European Union.
- The guide is a freely accessible open-source document.
- The guide references various other acknowledged standards, such as the _New Oxford Dictionary for Writers and Editors_, as supplementary resources.
