生铁、熟铁、钢的比较;Comparison of Pig Iron, Wrought Iron and Steel;
"生铁、熟铁和钢都是铁和碳的合金。含碳量小于0.05%为熟铁，含碳0.05%到2%为钢，含碳2%到6.67%为生铁。
熟铁是人类早期炼得的，是矿石在摄氏800到1000度的温度条件下，由木炭还原直接得到的。出炉时，熟铁呈现出含有大量非金属夹杂的海绵状固体块，因为含碳量很低，所以质地很软，强度和硬度均较低，用途不广，只能制造一些形状简单的器物。生铁是在摄氏1150到1300度的温度条件下炼得的，出炉时呈液态，可连续生产，可浇铸成型，非金属夹杂少，质地硬而脆，几乎没有塑性。钢是在铁的基础上加工所得，具有生铁和熟铁各自的优点，为人类广泛利用。";"Pig iron, wrought iron and steel are alloys of iron and carbon. The alloy with carbon content less than 0.05% is called as wrought iron, the one with carbon content of 0.05%-2% is called as steel, and pig iron has carbon content of 2%-6.67%.
What was refined in early times by human is wrought iron, which was directly obtained from charcoal reduction of mine under the temperature condition of 800-1000°C. Wrought iron is a spongy solid mass including a lot of non-metallic inclusion when leaving furnace, it has a soft texture due to low carbon content, as well as a low strength and rigidity, and therefore it has a limited use and is only used to make some implements with simple shapes. Pig iron is refined under the temperature condition of 1150-1300°C and is in liquid state when leaving the furnace, and can be continuously produced and casted in shape, with little non-metal inclusion, hard and crisp texture, and no plasticity at all.

中国古代趣味物理实验——“固体传声”实验;"Interesting Physical Test in Ancient China —— ""Solid-borne Sound Transmission"" Test";标点符号
清代徐珂著《清稗类钞》记载：“截竹筒两枚，空其两端，各以一面用皮纸冒之，胶封甚固。两筒纸面相向。取长数丈细线穿过之，使两人各执一筒，一人属口于此筒之空面，一人属耳于彼筒之空面，相去数丈，属口者随意言语，属耳者听之了了，他人不闻也。”这是一个证明固体也能传声的实验。当有人对着细线一端的竹筒（发话筒）讲话时，空气发生振动，它推动皮纸与细线振动。此时，细线另一端的皮纸也跟着振动，这样皮纸又带动竹筒（受话筒）内空气振动，把声音传给受话的一方。这里，话筒起着共鸣箱的作用。在中国古代战争中，为了判断敌方是否通过挖掘地道向城内发起进攻，便会采取这种方式来侦查。;"Qing Bal Lel Chao written by Xu Ke of the Qing Dynasty recorded: ""Cut two bamboo tubes, make their both ends empty, cover one side of each tube with leather paper, and seal it with glue tightly.

This was a test to prove that solid can also transmit sound. When a person speaks to bamboo tube (speaking tube) at one end of threadlet, the air vibrates and promotes vibration of leather paper and threadlet. At that moment, leather paper at the other end of threadlet also vibrates and thus drives air to vibrate in bamboo tube (voice receiving tube), and sound is transmitted to the party of receiving tube.

透光镜之所以透光，主要是由于镜背纹饰而出现了明显的厚薄差异，使得镜体的合金在浇注后的结晶过程中，不同的厚度处形成了不同的金相结构。不同金相结构的硬度不同，致使镜面经过磨削等加工后，在与镜背纹饰相应处，出现微观曲率差异。由于长光程放大效应和不同金相结构的反射率不同，就在屏幕上形成了背面的花纹字迹。";"Light transmitting mirror was a copper mirror with unique optics effect, when its front side faced sunshine, it could be clearly seen of figures and writing on the back in the image reflected on screen from mirror surface, as if the light reflected figures and writing on the back passing through mirror.

"扁钟钟声衰减比圆形钟快。因为扁钟截面由两个圆弧对称组成，近似两片瓦扣合在一起，在相交处形成锐边，这个锐边阻碍声波传递；另外，大量的权乳起到振动负载的作用。所以扁钟钟声衰减较快。
扁钟有一钟双音现象，而圆钟只能发出一个音。这主要是由于扁钟采用了合瓦形的结构，使得一件扁钟上能够同时存在两种不同的“基频”，由于正鼓音的基音腹点恰好是侧鼓音基音的节点，而侧鼓音的基音腹点恰好是正鼓音基音的节点。因此，分别敲击扁钟的正鼓部和侧鼓部，就可以发出两个不同的乐音。圆形钟，由于其圆形对称性，其基频振动和敲击点无关。";"The chime of flat bell attenuates faster than that of the round bell. There are two arcs composed in symmetry on the flat bell section, nearly two pieces of tiles are put together forming a sharp edge at the junction, such sharp edge hinders the sound wave propagation; in addition, lots of swells play the role of vibrating loads. Therefore the flat bell chime attenuates faster.
The flat bell has two tones while the round bell has only one. This is because the flat bell adopts closed tile shape structure making a flat bell have two different ""fundamental frequencies"" at the same time, while the fundamental tone antinodes of the Middle Tone are just the nodes of the fundamental tone of the Side Tone and the fundamental tone antinodes of the Side Tone just the nodes of the fundamental tone of the Middle Tone.

Correspondingly, 8 dragons with a small cooper pearl in their mouth are set outside the instrument, and there is a toad with an opening mouth upward under each dragon's head. In case of earthquake, the thick column loses balance due to seismic wave, and pushes away the set of leverage along the seismic wave, which leads to dragon head to disgorge the pearl, which falls into the mouth of toad; then time and direction of earthquake are reported based on direction of sound and pearl falling. According to record of historical data, Houfeng Seismograph once successfully recorded a violent earthquake in 138 in Gansu.
According to record of History of the Later Han Dynasty Biography of Zhangheng, scientists in various countries of the world once tried to recover Zhangheng's Houfeng Seismograph. Among all recovery schemes, main academic views are divided into two schools, one school fakes the position of simple and up-right rod structure, and the other one advocates to adopt suspended pendulum structure.

The ruler to measure universe and viewing deck compose a giant gnomon, and stone dial is in the direction of meridian. The center of dial surface and both sides have scale to measure length of shadow. Based on variation of length of projection of beam at stone dial, spring equinox, summer solstice, autumn equinox and winter solstice are determined to separate four seasons. For accurate observation, Guo Shoujing also invented ""Jingfu"", namely a copper slice with a width of two cuns and a length of four cuns penetrated with pinhole was put on the rack to move back and forward on dial surface, and projected sun and beam of gnomon on dial surface clearly, substantially and finely through pinhole of Jingfu by the principle of pinhole imaging.
