生铁、熟铁、钢的比较;Comparison of Pig Iron, Wrought Iron and Steel;
"生铁、熟铁和钢都是铁和碳的合金。含碳量小于0.05%为熟铁，含碳0.05%到2%为钢，含碳2%到6.67%为生铁。

熟铁是人类早期炼得的，是矿石在摄氏800到1000度的温度条件下，由木炭还原直接得到的。出炉时，熟铁呈现出含有大量非金属夹杂的海绵状固体块，因为含碳量很低，所以质地很软，强度和硬度均较低，用途不广，只能制造一些形状简单的器物。生铁是在摄氏1150到1300度的温度条件下炼得的，出炉时呈液态，可连续生产，可浇铸成型，非金属夹杂少，质地硬而脆，几乎没有塑性。钢是在铁的基础上加工所得，具有生铁和熟铁各自的优点，为人类广泛利用。";"Pig iron, wrought iron and steel are alloys of iron and carbon. The alloy with carbon content less than 0.05% is called as wrought iron,the one with carbon content of 0.05%-2% is called as steel, and pig iron has carbon content of 2%-6.67%.

What was refined in early times by human is wrought iron, which was directly obtained from charcoal reduction of mine under the temperature condition of 800-1000°C. Wrought iron is a spongy solid mass including a lot of non-metallic inclusion when leaving furnace, it has a soft texture due to low carbon content, as well as a low strength and rigidity, and therefore it has a limited use and is only used to make some implements with simple shapes. Pig iron is refined under the temperature condition of 1150-1300°C and is in liquid state when leaving the furnace, and can be continuously produced and casted in shape, with little non-metal inclusion,hard and crisp texture, and no plasticity at all.

汉代冶铁技术;Han Dynasty's lron Smelting Technology;

东汉初年，南阳太守杜诗发明了水排，用水轮带动皮囊鼓风，不但节省 了人力、畜力，而且提高了鼓风能力，促进了汉代治铁技术的发展。

Such technology refers to laying iron ore and charcoal alternatively in blast furnace, heating to 1150-1300°C to make it turn to melted iron, which is made into ironware in various shapes via mould casting. Pig iron failed to be smelted until the 14th century in Europe.

In the early years of East Han Dynasty, Du Shi, Prefecture chief of Nanyang invented hydraulic bellows, which drove leather bag for blast with water wheels, not only saved human and animal power, but also improved blast capacity and boosted development of iron smelting technology.
