An inner city is built in the middle of the north city with the east-west width of 2.820m and south-north length of 3,336m. an area of 9.4 square kilometers, divided into north the south parts. The imperial city is 1.844m away from the south part with central government offices built and centralize in the city. The imperial palace is 1.492m away from the north part, which includes the Tai Chi Palace, Prince Palace and palace residence of concubines as the Supply&amp;Service Section. The north side of imperial palace is next to the outer north wall, the inner courtyard and forbidden courtyard are outside. Inside the outer city wall, the rectangular residential wards are built outside the imperial palace and imperial city. To the south of imperial city, the part with the same width as the imperial city is divided into four lines in the east-west direction, and each line is divided into nine residential blocks in the south-north direction, with a total of thirty-six residential blocks: It is respectively divided into three lines in the east-west direction at the east and west sides of the imperial city and imperial palace with each line divided into thirteen residential blocks, with a total of seventy-eight blocks; Two blocks respectively in the east and west sides are built as the east market and west market, as a result there are a total of one hundred and ten residential blocks. All blocks have the same east-west width or the south-north length, all of which correspond to the length and width of the imperial city and imperial palace. Among the blocks, there are nine north-south streets and twelve east-west streets, and there are four Shuncheng streets respectively in four directions along the outer city wall, which together combine the street network like a checkerboard within the whole city. The scale is unparalleled in Chinese urban history.</p>
<p>Pingjiang City in the Southern Song Dynasty is the Suzhou City today. in the inscription museum in Suzhou City, there is a stele engraved with an ancient urban map on show with the height of 2.76m and the width of 1.42m.

</td><td><p>It is an astro observation instrument in ancient China, designed and created by Guo Shoujing (an astronomer in Yuan Dynasty).<br>
The scaphe body is a copper semi-sphere in a diameter of about three meters, looking like a lying cauldron, hence the name. On the internal spherical surface of scaphe, there are some crisscross regular reseaus engraved for the purpose of measuring the position of celestial body. A circle of water channel is carved on the opening of scaphe for water injection to adjust the cauldron opening horizontal; 24 lines are craved evenly on the edge of water channel for the direction indication. There are two crisscross poles placed in the due south-north direction on scribed line in the due south, which extend to the center of scaphe. A small square slab with a central hole bored is installed on the north end of the pole and such slab can rotate around the scaphe center. When the sunlight is through the central hole, the sun image will be projected on the internal spherical surface of scaphe, and the observer can directly read the sun position on the reseau. In case of solar eclipse, it can determine the accurate moment and orientation in various periods in the whole solar eclipse course.<br>

</td></tr><tr><td><p>扁钟钟声衰减比圆形钟快。因为扁钟截面由两个圆弧对称组成，近似两片瓦扣合在一起，在相交处形成锐边，这个锐边阻碍声波传递；另外，大量的权乳起到振动负载的作用。所以扁钟钟声衰减较快。<br>
扁钟有一钟双音现象，而圆钟只能发出一个音。这主要是由于扁钟采用了合瓦形的结构，使得一件扁钟上能够同时存在两种不同的“基频”，由于正鼓音的基音腹点恰好是侧鼓音基音的节点，而侧鼓音的基音腹点恰好是正鼓音基音的节点。因此，分别敲击扁钟的正鼓部和侧鼓部，就可以发出两个不同的乐音。圆形钟，由于其圆形对称性，其基频振动和敲击点无关。</p>
</td><td><p>The chime of flat bell attenuates faster than that of the round bell. There are two arcs composed in symmetry on the flat bell section, nearly two pieces of tiles are put together forming a sharp edge at the junction, such sharp edge hinders the sound wave propagation; in addition, lots of swells play the role of vibrating loads. Therefore the flat bell chime attenuates faster.<br>
The flat bell has two tones while the round bell has only one. This is because the flat bell adopts closed tile shape structure making a flat bell have two different "fundamental frequencies" at the same time, while the fundamental tone antinodes of the Middle Tone are just the nodes of the fundamental tone of the Side Tone and the fundamental tone antinodes of the Side Tone just the nodes of the fundamental tone of the Middle Tone. As a result, separately knocking on the Middle and Side parts of the flat bell can send two different musical tones.

透光镜之所以透光，主要是由于镜背纹饰而出现了明显的厚薄差异，使得镜体的合金在浇注后的结晶过程中，不同的厚度处形成了不同的金相结构。不同金相结构的硬度不同，致使镜面经过磨削等加工后，在与镜背纹饰相应处，出现微观曲率差异。由于长光程放大效应和不同金相结构的反射率不同，就在屏幕上形成了背面的花纹字迹。</p>

Light transmitting mirror has had a long History in china and the earliest one to be known was in Warring States period (475 B.C.—221 B.C.).<br>
Light transmitting of light transmitting mirror is mainly due to obvious thickness difference from sculpture on back of mirror, which enables position with different thickness to form different metallographical structures during crystallization process of mirror body after alloy casting. Different metallographical structures have different rigidities, which results in microcosmic curvature difference occurring in the part with sculpture on mirror back after mirror surface processed with grinding, etc. Because of enlargement effect of long optical distance and different reflectivity of different metallographical structures, figures and writing on the back forms on the screen.</p>

"The lower part of human body is in higher place; the higher part of human body is in lower place. When feet covering the lower light, the image forms on the upside, and when head covering upper light, the image forms in bottom. There is a pinhole in the light course near or far, so the image is upside-down”. Most scholars considers that main meaning of the texts is that pin-hole forms an inverted image in darkened enclosure, as there is a "pinhole" in the position where ray of light intersects, the lower light shines to high place after shining human body, and the higher light shines to lower place after shining human body. The size of image relates to the distance between the people and the pinhole, and a long distance corresponds to a small image; while a short distance corresponds to a big image.<br>
It is known that the overseas countries first conducted such research in the early 11th century.<br>

In this way, when playing its "ying" chord, the paperman bounces, and when playing other chords, the paperman remains still. Its meaning is that: if you desire to know "ying" chord of a chord, adjust the sound of each chord correctly (as per pentatonic scale), and then cut a paperman to be put on such chord. In this way, when playing its "ying" chord, the paperman bounces, and when playing other chords, the paperman remains still. This is the famous "paperman's resonance" test. The so-called resonance refers to the phenomenon that when an object vibrates, the other object vibrates along with it as well. For two objects that resonance occurs to, their inherent frequencies are certainly same or in simple ratio of integers.</p>

According to the two records, cut an ice cube into oblate shape, two sides bulge as sphere surface, and lift it up to make one side against sun. In this manner, sun converges to one point through ice tube, put some dry inflammables such as wormwood over there and these materials will be lighted slowly. Zheng Fuguang of Qing Dynasty once made the test.

Paper side of both tubes is in opposite direction. Take a threadlet with a length of several zhang to run through. Two persons hold each tube, one person put the empty side of the tube on his/her mouth, the other person put empty side of the other tube on his/her ear; with a distance of several zhang, the person with tube on his/her mouth speaks anything, and the person with tube on his/her ear could hear it clearly, while others fail to hear." This was a test to prove that solid can also transmit sound. When a person speaks to bamboo tube (speaking tube) at one end of threadlet, the air vibrates and promotes vibration of leather paper and threadlet. At that moment, leather paper at the other end of threadlet also vibrates and thus drives air to vibrate in bamboo tube (voice receiving tube), and sound is transmitted to the party of receiving tube. Here, voice tube acts as "resonance" box. In ancient China, someone led off an attack to inside of a city by means of excavating tunnel, and to identify whether the enemy adopts this means, scout should be made.</p>

Chen Zi had put forward a common Pythagorean Theorem in the 5th or 6th century BC. The hypotenuse is obtained by the extraction of a root from the sum of the squared shorter and the longer leg of a right triangle. in the annotation to <em>Zhou Bi Suan Jing</em> in the Three Kingdoms Period, Zhao Shuang has used the out-in complementary principle to proof the Pythagorean Theorem via the "chordal graph" on the "Pythagorean constructive proof diagram".</p>

The cover of reverse pot is a dummy. During water pouring, put the pot upside down, and pour water from the hole at the bottom of the pot. The hole is on the lower end of the central conduit. Because the water levels of the connecting vessels are at the same height, as long as the water level is lower than the lower end of the spout conduit, there will be no water flowing out from the spout during water pouring. When the pot is turned back, because the water level is lower than the upper end of the central conduit, there will be no water leaking from the hole.</p>

It is widely known that the traditional classic foy "seven-piece puzzle" in ancient China is composed of seven plates. Similar to the seven-piece puzzle, the "intelligence promotion diagram" is composed of fifteen plates (see the figure below). Compared to the seven-piece puzzle, the "intelligence promotion diagram" is available for more patterns which are more exquisite and vivid due to the more modules and forms. The inventor Tong Yegeng once used the "intelligence promotion diagram" to form thousands of words together with his children. Then the Thousand Character Classic from the Intelligence Promotion Diagram was published upon the arrangement of Tong Yegeng and the sketch of his youngest son Tong Danian. The book has described the puzzle game "intelligence promotion diagram" in details as well as the fascinating subtle playing method. Due to the ingenious conception and mind-inspiring. Prince Kung of Qing Dynasty had written an inscription for Thousand Character Classic from the Intelligence Promotion Diagram in his own hand. In addition to such book.

熟铁是人类早期炼得的，是矿石在摄氏800到1000度的温度条件下，由木炭还原直接得到的。出炉时，熟铁呈现出含有大量非金属夹杂的海绵状固体块，因为含碳量很低，所以质地很软，强度和硬度均较低，用途不广，只能制造一些形状简单的器物。生铁是在摄氏1150到1300度的温度条件下炼得的，出炉时呈液态，可连续生产，可浇铸成型，非金属夹杂少，质地硬而脆，几乎没有塑性。钢是在铁的基础上加工所得，具有生铁和熟铁各自的优点，为人类广泛利用。</p>
</td><td><p>Pig iron, wrought iron and steel are alloys of iron and carbon. The alloy with carbon content less than 0.05% is called as wrought iron, the one with carbon content of 0.05%-2% is called as steel, and pig iron has carbon content of 2%-6.67%.<br>
What was refined in early times by human is wrought iron, which was directly obtained from charcoal reduction of mine under the temperature condition of 800-1000°C. Wrought iron is a spongy solid mass including a lot of non-metallic inclusion when leaving furnace, it has a soft texture due to low carbon content, as well as a low strength and rigidity, and therefore it has a limited use and is only used to make some implements with simple shapes. Pig iron is refined under the temperature condition of 1150-1300°C and is in liquid state when leaving the furnace, and can be continuously produced and casted in shape, with little non-metal inclusion, hard and crisp texture, and no plasticity at all. Steel is processed based on iron, has advantages of pig iron and wrought iron, and is widely used by human.</p>

| 模拟量与数字量的联系吧                       | analog and digital volume of the link                                      |
| 简单来说 数字量是由0和1组成的信号            | In simple terms the number is composed of 0 and 1 components of the signal |
| 经过编码形成有规律的信号                     | through the code to form a regular signal                                  |
| 量化后的模拟量就是数字量                     | quantitative simulation is the number of digital                           |
| 模拟量也可以看作是数字量                     | the analog quantity can also be regarded as the continuous change of       |
| 在时间和数值上连续的变化                     | the mumber in the time and the numerical value                             |
